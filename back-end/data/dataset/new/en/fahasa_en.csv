New York Times Bestseller


“Smart and funny and all sorts of raunchy in the best way.” — San Francisco Chronicle


Repeat New York Times bestselling author Christopher Moore returns to the mean streets of San Francisco in this outrageous follow-up to his madcap novel Noir.


San Francisco, 1947. Bartender Sammy “Two Toes” Tiffin and the rest of the Cookie’s Coffee Irregulars—a ragtag bunch of working mugs last seen in Noir—are on the hustle: they’re trying to open a driving school; shanghai an abusive Swedish stevedore; get Mable, the local madam, and her girls to a Christmas party at the State Hospital without alerting the overzealous head of the S.F.P.D. vice squad; all while Sammy’s girlfriend, Stilton (a.k.a. the Cheese), and her “Wendy the Welder” gal pals are using their wartime shipbuilding skills on a secret project that might be attracting the attention of some government Men in Black. And, oh yeah, someone is murdering the city’s drag kings and club owner Jimmy Vasco is sure she’s next on the list and wants Sammy to find the killer.


Meanwhile, Eddie “Moo Shoes” Shu has been summoned by his Uncle Ho to help save his opium den from Squid Kid Tang, a vicious gangster who is determined to retrieve a priceless relic: an ancient statue of the powerful Rain Dragon that Ho stole from one of the fighting tongs forty years earlier. And if Eddie blows it, he just might call down the wrath of that powerful magical creature on all of Fog City.

Based on the New York Times bestselling novel by Leigh Bardugo, this graphic novel adaptation brings to life Diana's first adventure beyond the hidden shores of Themyscira.


Diana longs to prove herself to her legendary warrior sisters. But when the opportunity finally comes, she throws away her chance at glory and breaks Amazon law--risking exile--to save a mere mortal. Even worse, Alia Keralis is no ordinary girl and with this single brave act, Diana may have doomed the world.


Alia just wanted to escape her overprotective brother with a semester at sea. She doesn't know she is being hunted. When a bomb detonates aboard her ship, Alia is rescued by a mysterious girl of extraordinary strength and forced to confront a horrible truth: Alia is a Warbringer--a direct descendant of the infamous Helen of Troy, fated to bring about an age of bloodshed and misery.


Together, Diana and Alia will face an army of enemies--mortal and divine--determined to either destroy or possess the Warbringer. If they have any hope of saving both their worlds, they will have to stand side by side against the tide of war.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781401282554.jpg,"Louise Simonson, Leigh Bardugo, Kit Seaton",Penguin Books,2020,190,Tiếng Anh,Graphic Novels: Superheroes,https://www.fahasa.com/wonder-woman-warbringer-the-graphic-novel.html

New York Times bestselling author Laurie Halse Anderson (Speak, Shout) and artist Leila del Duca reimagine Wonder Woman's origins in this timely story about the refugee experience, teenage activism, and finding the love and strength to create change.


Princess Diana of Themyscira believes that her 16th birthday will be one of new beginnings--namely, acceptance into the warrior tribe of the Amazons. But her birthday celebrations are cut short when rafts carrying refugees break through the barrier that separates her island home from the outside world. When Diana defies the Amazons to try to bring the outsiders to safety, she finds herself swept away by the stormy sea.


Cut off from everything she's ever known, Diana herself becomes a refugee in an unfamiliar land. Now Diana must survive in the world beyond Themyscira for the first time--a world that is filled with danger and injustice unlike anything she's ever experienced. With new battles to be fought and new friends to be made, she must redefine what it means to belong, to be an Amazon, and to make a difference.

Taking Tom Murray Home,"Taking Tom Murray Home


The winner of the inaugural Banjo Prize, Taking Tom Murray Home is a funny, moving, bittersweet Australian story of fires, families and the restorative power of community.


Bankrupt dairy farmer Tom Murray decides he'd rather sell off his herd and burn down his own house than hand them over to the bank. But something goes tragically wrong, and Tom dies in the blaze. His wife, Dawn, doesn't want him to have died for nothing and decides to hold a funeral procession for Tom as a protest, driving 350 kilometres from Yardley in country Victoria to bury him in Melbourne where he was born. To make a bigger impact she agrees with some neighbours to put his coffin on a horse and cart and take it slow - real slow.

But on the night of their departure, someone burns down the local bank. And as the motley funeral procession passes through Victoria, there are more mysterious arson attacks. Dawn has five days to get to Melbourne. Five days, five more towns, and a state ready to explode in flames ...


Told with a laconic, deadpan wit, Taking Tom Murray Home is a timely, thought-provoking, heart-warming, quintessentially Australian story like no other. It's a novel about grief, pain, anger and loss, yes, but it's also about hope - and how community, friends and love trump pain and anger, every time.

Ellie is tired of being fat-shamed and does something about it in this poignant debut novel-in-verse.


Cover may vary.


Ever since Ellie wore a whale swimsuit and made a big splash at her fifth birthday party, she's been bullied about her weight. To cope, she tries to live by the Fat Girl Rules—like ""no making waves,"" ""avoid eating in public,"" and ""don't move so fast that your body jiggles."" And she's found her safe space—her swimming pool—where she feels weightless in a fat-obsessed world. In the water, she can stretch herself out like a starfish and take up all the room she wants. It's also where she can get away from her pushy mom, who thinks criticizing Ellie's weight will motivate her to diet. Fortunately, Ellie has allies in her dad, her therapist, and her new neighbor, Catalina, who loves Ellie for who she is. With this support buoying her, Ellie might finally be able to cast aside the Fat Girl Rules and starfish in real life--by unapologetically being her own fabulous self.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781984814500.jpg,Lisa Fipps,Penguin Books,2021,256,Tiếng Anh,Poetry,https://www.fahasa.com/starfish-hardback.html

A witty and warm-hearted novel about a trans teen finding his place in the world perfect for fans of  Red, White and Royal Blue


There’s only one thing standing between Finch Kelly and a full-blown case of high school senioritis: the National Speech & Debate Tournament. Taking home the gold would not only be the pinnacle of Finch’s debating career, but the perfect way to launch himself into his next chapter: college in Washington, DC, and a history-making career as the first trans congressman. What could possibly go wrong?


Well, for starters, Finch could develop a teeny tiny crush on his very attractive, very taken, and very gay debate partner, Jonah. Never mind that Finch has never considered whether he’s interested in more than just girls. And that dream of college in DC? Finch hasn’t exactly been accepted anywhere yet, let alone received the full-ride scholarship he'll need to make this dream a reality.


Worst of all, though, is this year's topic for Nationals: transgender rights. If he wants to cinch the gold, and get into college, Finch might have to argue against his own humanity.


People say there are two sides to every argument. But, as Finch is about to discover, some things—like who you are and who you love—are not up for debate.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780593322819.jpg,Peyton Thomas,Penguin Books,2021,304,Tiếng Anh,Romance,https://www.fahasa.com/both-sides-now.html

#1 New York Times Bestseller


What would happen if we called on God for help and God actually appeared? In Mitch Albom’s profound new novel of hope and faith, a group of shipwrecked passengers pull a strange man from the sea. He claims to be “the Lord.” And he says he can only save them if they all believe in him.


Adrift in a raft after a deadly ship explosion, ten people struggle for survival at sea. Three days pass. Short on water, food and hope, they spot a man floating in the waves. They pull him in.


“Thank the Lord we found you,” a passenger says.


“I am the Lord,” the man whispers.


So begins Mitch Albom’s most beguiling novel yet.


Albom has written of heaven in the celebrated number one bestsellers The Five People You Meet in Heaven and The First Phone Call from Heaven. Now, for the first time in his fiction, he ponders what we would do if, after crying out for divine help, God actually appeared before us?


In The Stranger in the Lifeboat, Albom keeps us guessing until the end: Is this strange man really who he claims to be? What actually happened to cause the explosion? Are the survivors in heaven, or are they in hell? The story is narrated by Benji, one of the passengers, who recounts the events in a notebook that is discovered—a year later—when the empty life raft washes up on the island of Montserrat. It falls to the island’s chief inspector, Jarty LeFleur, a man battling his own demons, to solve the mystery of what really happened. 


A fast-paced, compelling novel that makes you ponder your deepest beliefs, The Stranger in the Lifeboat suggests that answers to our prayers may be found where we least expect them.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780751584530.jpg,Mitch Albom,Hachette UK Distribution,2021,288,Tiếng Anh,Contemporary Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/the-stranger-in-the-lifeboat-409758.html

1814 promises to be another eventful season, but not, This Author believes, for Anthony Bridgerton, London's most elusive bachelor, who has shown no indication that he plans to marry. And in all truth, why should he? When it comes to playing the consummate rake, nobody does it better... Lady Whistledown's Society Papers, April 1814


Anthony Bridgerton needs a wife.


Having spent his twenties in a rakish pursuit of pleasure (whilst taking care to ensure the financial security of his mother and seven younger siblings and mother) he knows it's high time he settled down and ensured the continuation of the Bridgerton line.


Edwina Sheffield is considered the most beautiful debutante of the current season. She is also sweet, innocent and eminently biddable - Anthony is sure she'll make a perfectly acceptable wife and vows to make her his.


The only obstacle in his way is Edwina's older sister, Kate. Kate is determined to do all she can to allow her sister the chance to marry for love rather than convenience. And the roguish viscount is beginning to think he may have met his match in Kate's keen wit and sharp tongue. Until, that is, he makes the mistake of kissing her...

- Her two-year-old is slathered in maple syrup

- Her four-year-old has a new self-inflicted haircut

- Her TOTALLY VINDICTIVE ex-husband has fired the nanny without warning


But nothing is going to stop her from making it to lunch with her literary agent.

Not even being banned from the restaurant they're meeting at.


When the discussion about Finlay's latest crime novel is misinterpreted by a woman sitting nearby as the plans of a hit-woman offering up her services, Finlay is finally promised the large sum of cash she's always hoped for. Just not for her writing.


For this, she'll need to plot something much bigger than her novel.

'I loved BLACKTOP WASTELAND' STEPHEN KING

'Stunning. Can't remember the last time I read such a powerful crime novel' MARK BILLINGHAM


""Bug"" Montage: honest mechanic, loving family man. He's no longer the criminal he was - the sharpest wheelman east of the Mississippi.


But when his respectable life crumbles, a shady associate comes calling with a one-time job promising a huge payout. Inexorably drawn to the driver's seat - and haunted by the ghost of his outlaw father - Bug is yanked back into a savage world of bullets and betrayal.


Like Breaking Bad in a high-speed collision with Drive, this dazzling novel holds up a cracked mirror to the American Dream - and tells the story of one man pushed to his limits by poverty, race and a self-destructive masculinity.

Fortune And Glory,"Fortune And Glory


The twenty-seventh entry in Janet Evanovich's No.1 New York Times bestselling series isn't just the biggest case of Stephanie Plum's career. It's the adventure of a lifetime.


**The No. 1 New York Times bestseller!**


When Stephanie's beloved Grandma Mazur's new husband died on their wedding night, the only thing he left her was a beat-up old easy chair... and the keys to a life-changing fortune.


But as Stephanie and Grandma Mazur search for Jimmy Rosolli's treasure, they discover that they're not the only ones on the hunt. Two dangerous enemies from the past stand in their way-along with a new adversary who's even more formidable: Gabriela Rose, a dark-eyed beauty from Little Havana with a taste for designer clothes. She's also a soldier of fortune, a gourmet cook, an expert in firearms and mixed martial arts-and someone who's about to give Stephanie a real run for her money.


Stephanie may be in over her head, but she's got two things that Gabriela doesn't: an unbreakable bond with her family and a stubborn streak that will never let her quit.


She'll need both to survive because this search for ""fortune and glory"" will turn into a desperate race against time with more on the line than ever before. Because even as she searches for the treasure and fights to protect her Grandma Mazur, her own deepest feelings will be tested-as Stephanie could finally be forced to choose between Joe Morelli and Ranger.

This year's most sought-after invitation must surely be that of the Bridgerton masquerade ball, to be held Monday next. Will some fortunate young lady use the mystery of a masquerade night to snare one of the eligible bachelors? Lady Whistledown's Society Papers, May 1815


Sophie Beckett never dreamt she would sneak into Lady Bridgerton's famed masquerade ball - or that 'Prince Charming' would be waiting there for her! Though the daughter of an earl, Sophie had been relegated to the role of servant by her disdainful stepmother. But that night, spinning in the strong arms of the debonair and devastatingly handsome Benedict Bridgerton, she felt like royalty. Yet she knows all enchantments must end.


But Sophie has reckoned without Benedict's determined heart: he has sworn to find and wed his mystery miss, for he knows this is his only chance for a fairy tale love . . .

Beren And Lúthien,"Beren And Lúthien


Painstakingly restored from Tolkien’s manuscripts and presented for the first time as a continuous and standalone story, the epic tale of Beren and Lúthien will reunite fans of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings with Elves and Men, Dwarves and Orcs and the rich landscape and creatures unique to Tolkien’s Middle-earth.


The tale of Beren and Lúthien was, or became, an essential element in the evolution of The Silmarillion, the myths and legends of the First Age of the World conceived by J.R.R. Tolkien. Returning from France and the battle of the Somme at the end of 1916, he wrote the tale in the following year.


Essential to the story, and never changed, is the fate that shadowed the love of Beren and Lúthien: for Beren was a mortal man, but Lúthien was an immortal Elf. Her father, a great Elvish lord, in deep opposition to Beren, imposed on him an impossible task that he must perform before he might wed Lúthien. This is the kernel of the legend; and it leads to the supremely heroic attempt of Beren and Lúthien together to rob the greatest of all evil beings, Melkor, called Morgoth, the Black Enemy, of a Silmaril.


In this book Christopher Tolkien has attempted to extract the story of Beren and Lúthien from the comprehensive work in which it was embedded; but that story was itself changing as it developed new associations within the larger history. To show something of the process whereby this legend of Middle-earth evolved over the years, he has told the story in his father's own words by giving, first, its original form, and then passages in prose and verse from later texts that illustrate the narrative as it changed. Presented together for the first time, they reveal aspects of the story, both in event and in narrative immediacy, that were afterwards lost.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008503963.jpg,"J R R Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien",Usborne,2022,288,Tiếng Anh,Fantasy,https://www.fahasa.com/beren-and-luthien-open-market-europe-only.html

THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER


'A veritable treat' Daily Mail


The first novel in Julia Quinn's worldwide bestselling Bridgerton novels, now a series created by Shondaland for Netflix. This is the story of Daphne Bridgerton and the Duke: welcome to the ballrooms of Regency London . . .

________________________________________


Can there be any greater challenge to London's Ambitious Mamas than an unmarried duke? Lady Whistledown's Society Papers, April 1813


By all accounts, Simon Basset is on the verge of proposing to his best friend's sister, the lovely - and almost-on-the-shelf - Daphne Bridgerton. But the two of them know the truth - it's all an elaborate plan to keep Simon free from marriage-minded society mothers. And as for Daphne, surely she will attract some worthy suitors now that it seems a duke has declared her desirable . . .


Their ruse works like a charm - at first. But as Daphne waltzes across ballroom after ballroom with Simon, it's hard to remember that their courtship is a complete sham. Maybe it's his devilish smile, certainly it's the way his eyes seem to burn every time he looks at her. It wasn't the plan, but it seems she's falling for the duke, for real. And amidst the glittering, gossipy, cut-throat world of London's elite, there is only one certainty: love ignores every rule . . .

________________________________________

My dear Miss Bridgerton,


We have been corresponding now for quite some time, and although we have never formally met, I feel as if I know you. I am writing to invite you to visit me here at Romney Hall. It is my hope that after a suitable period of time, we might decide that we will suit, and you will consent to be my wife.


Did he think she was mad? Eloise Bridgerton couldn't marry a man she had never met! But before she knew it, she was in a hired carriage in the middle of the night, on her way to meet the man she hoped might be her perfect match.


Except . . . he wasn't. Her perfect husband wouldn't be so moody and ill-mannered, and while Phillip was certainly handsome, he was rough and rugged, and totally unlike the London gentlemen vying for her hand. But when he smiled . . . and when he kissed her . . . the rest of the world simply fell away. Could this imperfect man be perfect for her?

Landslide,"Landslide: The Final Days Of The Trump Presidency


'First there was Fire and Fury, then there was Siege, now there is Landslide. The third is the best of the three' Guardian


'Cruel, unforgiving, muckracking, scandalous . . . Michael Wolff concludes his Trump trilogy - with the best book' Telegraph


'Wolff is the shrewdest chronicler of Trump' Sunday Times


Politics has given us some shocking and confounding moments but none have come close to the careening final days of Donald Trump's presidency: the surreal stage management of his re-election campaign, his audacious election challenge, the harrowing mayhem of the storming of the Capitol and the buffoonery of the second impeachment trial. But what was really going on in the inner sanctum of the White House during these calamitous events? What did the president and his dwindling cadre of loyalists actually believe? And what were they planning?


Drawing on an exclusive and wide range of sources who took part in or witnessed Trump's closing moments, Michael Wolff finds the Oval Office more chaotic and bizarre than ever before, a kind of Star Wars bar scene. At all times of the day, Trump, hunched behind the Resolute desk, is surrounded by schemers and unqualified sycophants who spoon-feed him the 'alternative facts' he hungers to hear - about COVID-19, Black Lives Matter protests, and, most of all, his chance of winning re-election.


In this extraordinary telling of a unique moment in history, Wolff gives us front-row seats as Trump's circle of plotters is whittled down to the most enabling and the least qualified - and the president pushes the bounds of political convention, entertaining the idea of martial law and balking at calling off the insurrectionist mob that threatens the hallowed seat of democracy itself.


Michael Wolff pulled back the curtain on the Trump presidency with his globally bestselling blockbuster Fire and Fury.

The Sunday Times Top Ten bestseller

Alex Bellos, author of Alex's Adventures in Numberland


'If you aren't in love with stats before reading this book, you will be by the time you're done. Powerful, persuasive, and in these truth-defying times, indispensable'

Caroline Criado Perez, author of Invisible Women


In How to Make the World Add Up, Tim Harford draws on his experience as both an economist and presenter of the BBC's radio show 'More or Less' to take us deep into the world of disinformation and obfuscation, bad research and misplaced motivation to find those priceless jewels of data and analysis that make communicating with numbers so rewarding. Through vivid storytelling he reveals how we can evaluate the claims that surround us with confidence, curiosity and a healthy level of scepticism. It is a must-read for anyone who cares about understanding the world around them.


'Tim Harford is our most likeable champion of reason and rigour . . . clear, clever and always highly readable'

The Times, Books of the Year

'Wise and useful . . . such a delight'

When the emperor's rivals learn of her deception, there is hell to pay, but the war raging around Maia is nothing compared to the battle within.


Ever since she was touched by the demon Bandur, she has been changing . . . glancing in the mirror to see her own eyes glowing red; losing control of her magic, her body, her mind.

And don’t miss Elizabeth Lim’s new novel, the instant New York Times bestseller, Six Crimson Cranes!


“All the cutthroat competition of a runway fashion reality show and the thrilling exploits of an epic quest."" —The Washington Post


Maia Tamarin dreams of becoming the greatest tailor in the land, but as a girl, the best she can hope for is to marry well. When a royal messenger summons her ailing father, once a tailor of renown, to court, Maia makes the ultimate sacrifice and poses as a boy to take his place. She knows her life is forfeit if her secret is discovered, but she'll take that risk to achieve her dream and save her family from ruin. There's just one catch: Maia is one of twelve tailors in a cutthroat competition for the job.


Backstabbing and lies run rampant as the tailors compete in challenges to prove their artistry and skill. Maia's task is further complicated when she draws the attention of the court magician, Edan, whose piercing eyes seem to see straight through her disguise.


And nothing could have prepared her for the unthinkable final challenge: to sew three magic gowns for the emperor's reluctant bride-to-be, from the sun, the moon, and the stars. With this impossible task before her, she embarks on a journey to the far reaches of the kingdom, seeking the sun, the moon, and the stars, and finding more than she ever could have imagined.


Steeped in Chinese culture, sizzling with forbidden romance, and shimmering with magic, this fantasy novel is not to be missed.

Combo Sách Mindmap English Grammar - Ngữ Pháp Tiếng Anh Bằng Sơ Đồ Tư Duy + Tự Học 2000 Từ Vựng Tiếng Anh Theo Chủ Đề (Bộ 2 Cuốn),"Combo Sách Mindmap English Grammar - Ngữ Pháp Tiếng Anh Bằng Sơ Đồ Tư Duy + Tự Học 2000 Từ Vựng Tiếng Anh Theo Chủ Đề (Bộ 2 Cuốn)


1. Tự Học 2000 Từ Vựng Tiếng Anh Theo Chủ Đề


Nhà ngôn ngữ học nổi tiếng D.A.Wilkins đã nói rằng “Without grammar, very little can be conveyed; without vocabulary, nothing can be conveyed.” (Không có ngữ pháp, rất ít thông tin có thể được truyền đạt; Không có từ vựng, không một thông tin nào có thể được truyền đạt cả). Vì thế, trong việc học một ngoại ngữ, thì từ vựng có thể xem như các tế bào nhỏ hình thành nên khả năng sử dụng ngoại ngữ của người học.


Các bạn đang băn khoăn chưa biết nên học từ vựng như thế nào để có thể ghi nhớ được nhiều từ và lâu nhất. Dưới đây là những phương pháp học mà các bạn có thể áp dụng để học từ vựng hiệu quả nhất.


1. Học từ vựng theo chủ đề

Thay vì học riêng lẻ từng từ rời rạc, nếu các bạn biết nhóm chúng vào cùng một chủ đề thì đảm bảo việc học thuộc sẽ trở nên đơn giản hơn rất nhiều luôn. Có vốn từ vựng theo chủ đề, khi làm bài thi nói hoặc viết theo một chủ đề nào đó bạn sẽ phát huy được tối đa vốn từ vựng. Khiến bài nói và bài viết của bạn trôi chảy và nhiều ý tưởng. Vì vậy, việc học từ theo chủ đề cũng giống như một mũi tên trúng hai đích vậy, vừa giúp chúng ta biết thêm nhiều từ mới, vừa có nhiều từ vựng và ý hay để triển khai cho bài thi được tốt hơn.


2. Sử dụng hình ảnh, âm thanh hay câu chuyện để ghi nhớ từ vựng nhanh

Thực tế cho thấy, cách mà nhiều người thường hay học từ vựng đó là viết từ vựng đó kèm nghĩa ra giấy thật nhiều lần để ghi nhớ. Tuy nhiên, cách này có thể hiệu quả tức thời nhưng về lâu về dài, nếu không sử dụng lại thì chắc chắn ta sẽ quên từ. Ngược lại, nếu sử dụng những hình ảnh, âm thanh hay câu chuyện ấn tượng thì có thể khiến não bộ chúng ta nhớ rất mãi. Cách thức học này cũng vô cùng đơn giản, khi chúng ta học một từ mới, hãy cố gắng tự nghĩ ý tưởng và minh họa cho nó bằng hình ảnh ngộ nghĩnh, khi học một nhóm từ vựng theo chủ đề, hãy cố gắng sắp xếp chúng vào thành một đoạn văn, kể về một câu chuyện thú vị.


3. Học từ vựng qua bài hát, phim ảnh


Nhiều lúc do tâm lý nghĩ học tập là một gánh nặng, bắt buộc phải học mà khiến chúng ta mất đi niềm vui trong việc tiếp nhận tri thức. Nếu các bạn có thể giải tỏa tâm lý đó bằng việc nghe nhạc hay xem phim thì sẽ khiến từ mới “vào đầu” dễ dàng hơn mà không khiến ta chán nản khi học. Các bạn nên học từ vựng bằng những phim từ mức độ thấp đến cao. Rất nhiều bộ phim hay để học tiếng Anh như: Extra English, Friends, How I met your mother?...


4. Luôn có một cuốn sổ tay ghi từ mới

Cuốn sổ này sẽ cực kì hữu ích cho bạn trong việc học mọi lúc mọi nơi. Mỗi ngày bạn hay ghi vào quyển sổ đó những từ mới học được bao gồm nghĩa, họ từ và ngày nào cũng mở ra đọc và học lại như vậy từ vựng đó sẽ không bao giờ có thể quên được.


5. Tập sử dụng các từ mới và ôn tập thường xuyên

Sau khi học các từ mới, bạn nên tập sử dụng chúng hàng


2. Mindmap English Grammar - Ngữ Pháp Tiếng Anh Bằng Sơ Đồ Tư Duy


Trước đây, khi tiếng Anh chưa là ngôn ngữ quốc tế trong môi trường toàn cầu hóa, xu hướng việc giảng dạy và học tập tiếng Anh tại Việt Nam thiên về hai kỹ năng ĐỌC HIỂU và VIẾT. Hệ quả là trong các thế hệ trước, nhiều người đọc hiểu và viết tiếng Anh thông thạo không kém người bản xứ được học hành tử tế; ngược lại, gặp khó khăn khi giao tiếp nghe-nói bằng tiếng Anh.


Từ thập niên 90 thế kỷ trước đây, giao tiếp ngôn ngữ bao gồm bốn kỹ năng cơ bản: NGHE – NÓI - ĐỌC - VIẾT. Do vậy khi nói đến tiếng Anh giao tiếp có nghĩa là cần phải giao tiếp được cả bốn kỹ năng trên. Phương pháp giao tiếp dựa trên sự phát triển kỹ năng ngôn ngữ của trẻ em: giai đoạn đầu tập trung vào phát triển NGHE - NÓI; giai đoạn phát triển tập trung ĐỌC VIẾT. Nói như vậy không có nghĩa là khi dạy kỹ năng nghe nói thì không có yêu cầu phát triển kỹ năng đọc viết và ngược lại. Đối với môi trường giao lưu ngôn ngữ và kinh tế toàn cầu và phát triển khoa học ngày nay, kỹ năng dịch thuật và phiên dịch cũng nằm trong giao tiếp ngôn ngữ bậc cao trong môi trường toàn cầu hóa. Vai trò của ngữ pháp trong phát triển ngôn ngữ luôn là nền tảng để học và phát triển một ngôn ngữ. Để phát triển một ngôn ngữ, dù đó là ngoại ngữ như tiếng Anh, nền tảng của ngôn ngữ là ngữ pháp, từ vựng và phát âm. Do vậy, vai trò ngữ pháp là để phát triển ngôn ngữ đúng và đủ để phát triển kỹ năng giao tiếp; ngữ pháp không chỉ để hiểu về ngôn ngữ mà để sử dụng đúng ngôn ngữ (not knowing about the language, but knowing the language). Điều này cho thấy học ngữ pháp tiếng Anh ở Việt Nam là đúng vì tiếng Anh là EFL (ngoại ngữ), không phải ESL (ngôn ngữ thứ hai), tuy nhiên sự yếu kém trong việc học và dạy ngữ pháp là để làm bài tập, sau đó là bài thi mà không dùng ngữ pháp trong các hoạt động ngôn ngữ (activities) và thực hành ngôn ngữ (tasks). Nhằm góp phần hỗ trợ học ngữ pháp, MIND MAP ENGLISH GRAMMAR là công cụ để hiểu biết tiếng Anh dưới hình thức tóm lược theo tư duy logic. Do vậy người học cần sử dụng hiểu biết về ngữ pháp và quan trọng hơn là ứng dụng vào nhiều hoạt động thực hành để phát huy các chủ đề ngữ pháp trong cuốn sách.


Ngữ Pháp Tiếng Anh Bằng Sơ Đồ Tư Duy có những đặc điểm sau đây:


- Giảng viên có thể hướng dẫn cho người học các chủ đề và chủ điểm ngữ pháp theo tư duy logic qua các sơ đồ tư duy tóm tắt dễ nhớ và dễ hiểu.


- Người học dễ dàng tự học và tham khảo trước khi làm các bài tập ngữ pháp hoặc sử dụng tiếng Anh.


;- Hệ thống bài học được trình bày dạng ""mind map"" cách tân từ thấp lên cao nên người học yêu thích ngữ pháp tiếng Anh hơn.


- Sau khi học, hiểu, nắm vững các chủ đề, chủ điểm ngữ pháp, người học có thể tự vẽ lấy ""mind map"" của riêng mình.

Shadows In Death: An Eve Dallas Thriller (Book 51),"Shadows In Death: An Eve Dallas Thriller (Book 51)


As it often did since he'd married a cop, murder interrupted more pleasant activities. The again, Roarke supposed, the woman lying in a pool of her own blood a few steps inside the arch in Washington Square Park had a heftier complaint.


When a night out at the theatre is interrupted by the murder of a young woman in Washington Square Park, it seems like an ordinary case for Detective Eve Dallas and her team.

Eve has two complex cases on her hands - the shocking murder of this wealthy young mother and tracking down the shadow before he can strike again, this time much closer to home.

The Intelligence Trap: Revolutionise Your Thinking And Make Wiser Decisions,"The Intelligence Trap: Revolutionise Your Thinking And Make Wiser Decisions


How was a brilliant physics professor tricked into carrying 2kg of cocaine across the Argentinian border? Why do doctors misdiagnose 10 to 15% of their patients? Why do Nobel Prize winners spread fake news?


We assume that smarter people are less prone to error. But greater education and expertise can often amplify our mistakes while rendering us blind to our biases. This is the 'intelligence trap'.


Drawing on the latest behavioural science and historical examples from Socrates to Benjamin Franklin, David Robson demonstrates how to apply our intelligence more wisely; identify bias and enhance our 'rationality quotient'; read and regulate our emotions; fine-tune our intuition; navigate ambiguity and uncertainty; and think more flexibly about seemingly intractable problems.


The twenty-first century presents us with complex problems that demand a wiser way of thinking. Whether you are a NASA scientist or a school student, The Intelligence Trap offers a new cognitive toolkit to realise your full potential.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781473669857.jpg,David Robson,Hachette UK Distribution,2020,337,Tiếng Anh,Memory Improvement & Thinking Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/the-intelligence-trap.html
Humans: A Brief History Of How We F*cked It All Up,"Humans: A Brief History Of How We F*cked It All Up


'This book is brilliant. Utterly, utterly brilliant. Apart from the epilogue, which is idiotic' Jeremy Clarkson


'F*cking brilliant' Sarah Knight


AN EXHILARATING JOURNEY THROUGH THE MOST CREATIVE AND CATASTROPHIC F*CK-UPS OF HUMAN HISTORY


In the seventy thousand years that modern human beings have walked this earth, we've come a long way. Art, science, culture, trade - on the evolutionary food chain, we're real winners. But, frankly, it's not exactly been plain sailing, and sometimes - just occasionally - we've managed to really, truly, quite unbelievably f*ck things up.


From Chairman Mao's Four Pests Campaign, to the American Dustbowl; from the Austrian army attacking itself one drunken night, to the world's leading superpower electing a reality TV mogul as President... it's pretty safe to say that, as a species, we haven't exactly grown wiser with age.


So, next time you think you've really f*cked up, this book will remind you: it could be so much worse...

Camino Winds,"Camino Winds


The Sunday Times bestseller from international bestseller John Grisham.


Is a Perfect Storm the Perfect Time for a Murder?


'Another gem from John Grisham' Observer


When Hurricane Leo threatens Florida's Camino Island, the Governor is quick to issue an evacuation order. Most residents flee but a small group of diehards decide to ride it out. Amongst them is Bruce Cable, proprietor of Bay Books in downtown Santa Rosa.


The hurricane is devastating: homes and condos are levelled, hotels and storefronts ruined, streets flooded, and a dozen people are killed. One of the victims is Nelson Kerr, a friend of Bruce's who wrote timely political thrillers. But evidence suggests that the storm wasn't the cause of Nelson's death - he had received several mysterious blows to the head.


Who would want Nelson dead? The local police are overwhelmed with the aftermath of the storm and in no condition to handle the case. Bruce begins to wonder if the shady characters in Nelson's novels were more fact than fiction. And somewhere on Nelson's computer is the manuscript of his new novel - could the key to the case be right there, in black and white? Bruce starts to look into it and what he finds between the lines is more shocking than any of Nelson's plot twists - and far more dangerous.


Gripping, compelling and pacy, this exceptional thriller from international bestseller John Grisham is the perfect escapist read this summer.


Praise for Camino Winds:


'In American icon John Grisham's new novel, Camino Winds, an odd assortment of mystery and crime authors, some of them felons themselves, discover one of their colleagues has been murdered during the fury of a massive hurricane-the perfect crime scene' Delia Owens, author of Where the Crawdads Sing


'The Camino Island series, featuring trouble-prone bookseller Bruce Cable, is a perfect escapist mix of detective action, insider riffs on the literary world - and even a little romance' Mail on Sunday


'Camino Winds has all the usual Grisham hallmarks - a pacy plot and tension-filled scenes' Independent


'Another compelling read from Grisham, and will satisfy old fans and please new readers alike' Press Association


'The novel has enough plot twists to keep you engaged' The Herald

Dune 2: Dune Messiah,"Dune 2: Dune Messiah


DUNE MESSIAH: the extraordinary sequel to Dune, the greatest science fiction novel of all time.


Twelve years after his victory over House Harkonnen, Paul Atreides rules as emperor from the desert planet Arrakis - but his victory has had profound consequences. War has been brought to the entire known universe, and billions have already perished. Despite having become the most powerful emperor known to history, Paul is powerless to bring an end to the fighting.


While former allies conspire to dethrone Paul and even his own consort acts against him, Paul accepts a gift from the Tleilaxu, a guild of genetic manipulators, hoping to find a single spark of peace and friendship amidst the betrayal and chaos. But this act undermines Paul's support from the Fremen, his own people. The Fremen are the true source of Paul's power; losing them is the one thing that could truly topple his empire.


As matters escalate, Paul will be forced to chose between his throne, his wife, his people and his future - and the future of the entire universe.


An epic novel of the cost of victory... and the price of war.


Brilliant...it is all that Dune was, and maybe a little more.

Mrs March,"Mrs March


‘Nastily good fun’ Metro


SET TO BECOME A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE STARRING ELIZABETH MOSS


Shirley Jackson meets Ottessa Moshfegh meets My Sister the Serial Killer in a brilliantly unsettling and darkly funny debut novel full of suspense and paranoia


George March’s latest novel is a smash hit. None could be prouder than Mrs. March, his dutiful wife, who revels in his accolades and relishes the lifestyle and status his success brings.


A creature of routine and decorum, Mrs. March lives an exquisitely controlled existence on the Upper East Side. Every morning begins the same way, with a visit to her favourite patisserie to buy a loaf of olive bread, but her latest trip proves to be her last when she suffers an indignity from which she may never recover: an assumption by the shopkeeper that the protagonist in George March’s new book – a pathetic sex worker, more a figure of derision than desire – is based on Mrs. March.


One casual remark robs Mrs. March not only of her beloved olive bread but of the belief that she knew everything about her husband – and herself – sending her on an increasingly paranoid journey, one

that starts within the pages of a book but may very well uncover both a killer and the long-buried secrets of Mrs. March’s past.


A razor-sharp exploration of the fragility of identity and the smothering weight of expectations, Mrs. March heralds the arrival of a wicked and wonderful new voice.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008421755.jpg,Virginia Feito,Usborne,2022,304,Tiếng Anh,Contemporary Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/mrs-march-export-price.html
Morgoth's Ring,"Morgoth's Ring


The first of two companion volumes which documents the later writing of The Silmarillion, Tolkien's epic tale of war.


After The Lord of the Rings was at last achieved, J R R Tolkien turned his attention once again to 'the Matter of the Elder Days'. The text of the Annals of Aman, the 'Blessed Land' in the far West, is given in full; while in writings hitherto unknown is seen the nature of the problems that Tolkien explored in his later years, as new and radical ideas, portending upheaval in the old narratives, emerged at the heart of the mythology, and as the destinies of Men and Elves, mortals and immortals, became of central significance, together with a vastly enlarged perception of the evil of Melkor, the Shadow upon Arda.


The second part of this history of the later Silmarillion is concerned with developments in the legends of Beleriand after the completion of The Lord of the Rings.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780261103009.jpg,"J. R. R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien",Usborne,2011,496,Tiếng Anh,Fantasy,https://www.fahasa.com/morgoth-s-ring.html
Beren And Luthien,"Beren And Luthien


Painstakingly restored from Tolkien's manuscripts and presented for the first time as a continuous and standalone story, the epic tale of Beren and Luthien will reunite fans of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings with Elves and Men, Dwarves and Orcs and the rich landscape and creatures unique to Tolkien's Middle-earth.


The tale of Beren and Luthien was, or became, an essential element in the evolution of The Silmarillion, the myths and legends of the First Age of the World conceived by J.R.R. Tolkien. Returning from France and the battle of the Somme at the end of 1916, he wrote the tale in the following year.


Essential to the story, and never changed, is the fate that shadowed the love of Beren and Luthien: for Beren was a mortal man, but Luthien was an immortal Elf. Her father, a great Elvish lord, in deep opposition to Beren, imposed on him an impossible task that he must perform before he might wed Luthien. This is the kernel of the legend; and it leads to the supremely heroic attempt of Beren and Luthien together to rob the greatest of all evil beings, Melkor, called Morgoth, the Black Enemy, of a Silmaril.


In this book Christopher Tolkien has attempted to extract the story of Beren and Luthien from the comprehensive work in which it was embedded; but that story was itself changing as it developed new associations within the larger history. To show something of the process whereby this legend of Middle-earth evolved over the years, he has told the story in his father's own words by giving, first, its original form, and then passages in prose and verse from later texts that illustrate the narrative as it changed. Presented together for the first time, they reveal aspects of the story, both in event and in narrative immediacy, that were afterwards lost.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008214197.jpg,J.

Nick Miller is Central Division’s maverick Detective Sergeant. Disliked and distrusted by friends and foes, he works alone. He crosses the line. And he gets results.


The Graveyard Shift…


Nick Miller is new to the graveyard shift – the midnight hours when the driven and the desperate come out to play. Tonight Ben Garvald is out of prison. After nine years inside, he’s back in the old neighbourhood. Back to his remarried ex-wife. Back for revenge.


Brought in Dead…


Then after a fatal night out, a girl’s body is pulled from an isolated stretch of river. The last person to see her alive had enemies on both sides of the fence. Miller wants justice. But so does her father – with or without the law on his side.


Hell Is Always Today…


And the Rainlover. Whose victims are always women. Always at night when the streets are wet. He could be any one of a thousand men. Hounded by the public and the press, Miller needs to find him before he strikes again. It’s time to throw out the rule book in the line of duty.

In August 1942, beleaguered Malta was within weeks of surrender to the Axis, because its 300,000 people could no longer be fed. Churchill made a personal decision that at all costs, the 'island fortress' must be saved. This was not merely a matter of strategy, but of national prestige, when Britain's fortunes and morale had fallen to their lowest ebb.


The largest fleet the Royal Navy committed to any operation of the western war was assembled to escort fourteen fast merchantmen across a thousand of miles of sea defended by six hundred German and Italian aircraft, together with packs of U-boats and torpedo craft. The Mediterranean battles that ensued between 11 and 15 August were the most brutal of Britain's war at sea, embracing four aircraft-carriers, two battleships, seven cruisers, scores of destroyers and smaller craft. The losses were appalling: defeat seemed to beckon.

This is the saga Max Hastings unfolds in his first full length narrative of the Royal Navy, which he believes was the most successful of Britain's wartime services. As always, he blends the 'big picture' of statesmen and admirals with human stories of German U-boat men, Italian torpedo-plane crews, Hurricane pilots, destroyer and merchant-ship captains, ordinary but extraordinary seamen.


Operation Pedestal describes catastrophic ship sinkings, including that of the aircraft-carrier Eagle, together with struggles to rescue survivors and salvage stricken ships. Most moving of all is the story of the tanker Ohio, indispensable to Malta's survival, victim of countless Axis attacks. In the last days of the battle, the ravaged hulk was kept under way only by two destroyers, lashed to her sides. Max Hastings describes this as one of the most extraordinary tales he has ever recounted. Until the very last hours, no participant on either side could tell what would be the outcome of an epic of wartime suspense and courage.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008364984.jpg,Max Hastings,Usborne,2022,464,Tiếng Anh,Military Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/operation-pedestal-the-fleet-that-battled-to-malta-1942.html

The Story Of Kullervo,"The Story Of Kullervo


The world first publication of a previously unknown work of fantasy by J.R.R. Tolkien, which tells the powerful story of a doomed young man who is sold into slavery and who swears revenge on the magician who killed his father.


Kullervo son of Kalervo is perhaps the darkest and most tragic of all J.R.R. Tolkien's characters. 'Hapless Kullervo', as Tolkien called him, is a luckless orphan boy with supernatural powers and a tragic destiny.


Brought up in the homestead of the dark magician Untamo, who killed his father, kidnapped his mother, and who tries three times to kill him when still a boy, Kullervo is alone save for the love of his twin sister, Wanona, and guarded by the magical powers of the black dog, Musti. When Kullervo is sold into slavery he swears revenge on the magician, but he will learn that even at the point of vengeance there is no escape from the cruellest of fates.


Tolkien wrote that The Story of Kullervo was 'the germ of my attempt to write legends of my own', and was 'a major matter in the legends of the First Age'; his Kullervo was the ancestor of Turin Turambar, tragic incestuous hero of The Silmarillion. In addition to being a powerful story in its own right, The Story of Kullervo - published here for the first time with the author's drafts, notes and lecture-essays on its source-work, The Kalevala, is a foundation stone in the structure of Tolkien's invented world.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008131388.jpg,J.

Tolkien And The Great War: The Threshold Of Middle-earth,"Tolkien And The Great War: The Threshold Of Middle-earth


* TOLKIEN * Now a major motion picture


Acclaimed as 'the best book about Tolkien', this award-winning biography explores J.R.R. Tolkien's wartime experiences and their impact on his life and his writing of The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings.


""To be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than in 1939 ... by 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.""


So J.R.R. Tolkien responded to critics who saw The Lord of the Rings as a reaction to the Second World War. Tolkien and the Great War tells for the first time the full story of how he embarked on the creation of Middle-earth in his youth as the world around him was plunged into catastrophe. This biography reveals the horror and heroism that he experienced as a signals officer in the Battle of the Somme and introduces the circle of friends who spurred his mythology to life. It shows how, after two of these brilliant young men were killed, Tolkien pursued the dream they had all shared by launching his epic of good and evil.


John Garth argues that the foundation of tragic experience in the First World War is the key to Middle-earth's enduring power. Tolkien used his mythic imagination not to escape from reality but to reflect and transform the cataclysm of his generation. While his contemporaries surrendered to disillusionment, he kept enchantment alive, reshaping an entire literary tradition into a form that resonates to this day.


This is the first substantially new biography of Tolkien since 1977, meticulously researched and distilled from his personal wartime papers and a multitude of other sources.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780007119530.jpg,John Garth,Usborne,2014,416,Tiếng Anh,Biography: General,https://www.fahasa.com/tolkien-and-the-great-war.html

SHARPE IS BACK.

Lieutenant-Colonel Sharpe is a man with a reputation. Born in the gutter, raised a foundling, he joined the army twenty-one years ago, and it's been his home ever since. He's a loose cannon, but his unconventional methods make him a valuable weapon.


So when, the dust still settling after the Battle of Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington needs a favour, he turns to Sharpe. For Wellington knows that the end of one war is only the beginning of another. Napoleon's army may be defeated, but another enemy lies waiting in the shadows - a secretive group of fanatical revolutionaries hell-bent on revenge.


Sharpe is dispatched to a new battleground: the maze of Paris streets where lines blur between friend and foe. And in search of a spy, he will have to defeat a lethal assassin determined to kill his target or die trying . . .

A Secret Vice: Tolkien On Invented Languages,"A Secret Vice: Tolkien On Invented Languages


First ever critical study of Tolkien's little-known essay, which reveals how language invention shaped the creation of Middle-earth and beyond, to George R R Martin's Game of Thrones.


J.R.R. Tolkien's linguistic invention was a fundamental part of his artistic output, to the extent that later on in life he attributed the existence of his mythology to the desire to give his languages a home and peoples to speak them. As Tolkien puts it in 'A Secret Vice', 'the making of language and mythology are related functions''.


In the 1930s, Tolkien composed and delivered two lectures, in which he explored these two key elements of his sub-creative methodology. The second of these, the seminal Andrew Lang Lecture for 1938-9, 'On Fairy-Stories', which he delivered at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, is well known. But many years before, in 1931, Tolkien gave a talk to a literary society entitled 'A Hobby for the Home', where he unveiled for the first time to a listening public the art that he had both himself encountered and been involved with since his earliest childhood: 'the construction of imaginary languages in full or outline for amusement'.


This talk would be edited by Christopher Tolkien for inclusion as 'A Secret Vice' in The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays and serves as the principal exposition of Tolkien's art of inventing languages. This new critical edition, which includes previously unpublished notes and drafts by Tolkien connected with the essay, including his 'Essay on Phonetic Symbolism', goes some way towards re-opening the debate on the importance of linguistic invention in Tolkien's mythology and the role of imaginary languages in fantasy literature.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008131418.jpg,J.

The Fall Of Arthur,"The Fall Of Arthur


The world first publication of a previously unknown work by J.R.R. Tolkien, which tells the extraordinary story of the final days of England's legendary hero, King Arthur.


The Fall of Arthur, the only venture by J.R.R. Tolkien into the legends of Arthur King of Britain, may well be regarded as his finest and most skilful achievement in the use of the Old English alliterative metre, in which he brought to his transforming perceptions of the old narratives a pervasive sense of the grave and fateful nature of all that is told: of Arthur's expedition overseas into distant heathen lands, of Guinevere's flight from Camelot, of the great sea-battle on Arthur's return to Britain, in the portrait of the traitor Mordred, in the tormented doubts of Lancelot in his French castle.


Unhappily, The Fall of Arthur was one of several long narrative poems that he abandoned in that period. In this case he evidently began it in the earlier nineteen-thirties, and it was sufficiently advanced for him to send it to a very perceptive friend who read it with great enthusiasm at the end of 1934 and urgently pressed him 'You simply must finish it!' But in vain: he abandoned it, at some date unknown, though there is some evidence that it may have been in 1937, the year of the publication of The Hobbit and the first stirrings of The Lord of the Rings. Years later, in a letter of 1955, he said that 'he hoped to finish a long poem on The Fall of Arthur'; but that day never came.


Associated with the text of the poem, however, are many manuscript pages: a great quantity of drafting and experimentation in verse, in which the strange evolution of the poem's structure is revealed, together with narrative synopses and very significant if tantalising notes. In these latter can be discerned clear if mysterious associations of the Arthurian conclusion with The Silmarillion, and the bitter ending of the love of Lancelot and Guinevere, which was never written.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780007489947.jpg,J.

The Lay Of Aotrou And Itroun,"The Lay Of Aotrou And Itroun


Unavailable for more than 70 years, this early but important work is published for the first time with Tolkien's 'Corrigan' poems and other supporting material, including a prefatory note by Christopher Tolkien.


Set 'In Britain's land beyond the seas' during the Age of Chivalry, The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun tells of a childless Breton Lord and Lady ('Aotrou' and 'Itroun') and the tragedy that befalls them when Aotrou seeks to remedy their situation with the aid of a magic potion obtained from a corrigan, or malevolent fairy. When the potion succeeds and Itroun bears twins, the corrigan returns seeking her fee, and Aotrou is forced to choose between betraying his marriage and losing his life.


Coming from the darker side of J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination, The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun, together with the two shorter 'Corrigan' poems that lead up to it and are also included here, was the outcome of a comparatively short but intense period in Tolkien's life when he was deeply engaged with Celtic, and particularly Breton, myth and legend.


Written in 1930, this early but seminal work is an important addition to the non-Middle-earth portion of his canon alongside Tolkien's other retellings of myth and legend, The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun, The Fall of Arthur and The Story of Kullervo, a small but important corpus of his ventures into 'real-world' mythologies, each of which would be a formative influence on his own legendarium.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008202156.jpg,J.

Sir Gawain And The Green Knight: With Pearl And Sir Orfeo,"Sir Gawain And The Green Knight: With Pearl And Sir Orfeo


This smart new paperback edition contains the fully-reset text of three medieval English poems, translated by Tolkien for the modern-day reader and containing romance, tragedy, love, sex and honour. It features a beautifully decorated text and includes as a bonus the complete version of Tolkien's acclaimed lecture on Sir Gawain.


Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Pearl are two poems by an unknown author written in about 1400. Sir Gawain is a romance, a fairy-tale for adults, full of life and colour; but it is also much more than this, being at the same time a powerful moral tale which examines religious and social values.


Pearl is apparently an elegy on the death of a child, a poem pervaded with a sense of great personal loss: but, like Gawain it is also a sophisticated and moving debate on much less tangible matters.


Sir Orfeo is a slighter romance, belonging to an earlier and different tradition. It was a special favourite of Tolkien's.


The three translations represent the complete rhyme and alliterative schemes of the originals, and are uniquely accompanied with the complete text of Tolkien's acclaimed 1953 W.P. Ker Memorial Lecture that he delivered on Sir Gawain.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008433932.jpg,J. R. R.

The Legend Of Sigurd And Gudrun,"The Legend Of Sigurd And Gudrun


The world first publication of a previously unknown work by J.R.R. Tolkien, which tells the epic story of the Norse hero, Sigurd, the dragon-slayer, the revenge of his wife, Gudrun, and the Fall of the Nibelungs.


In the Lay of the Voelsungs is told the ancestry of the great hero Sigurd, the slayer of Fafnir most celebrated of dragons, whose treasure he took for his own; of his awakening of the Valkyrie Brynhild who slept surrounded by a wall of fire, and of their betrothal; and of his coming to the court of the great princes who were named the Niflungs (or Nibelungs), with whom he entered into blood-brotherhood. In that court there sprang great love but also great hate, brought about by the power of the enchantress, mother of the Niflungs, skilled in the arts of magic, of shape-changing and potions of forgetfulness.


In scenes of dramatic intensity, of confusion of identity, thwarted passion, jealousy and bitter strife, the tragedy of Sigurd and Brynhild, of Gunnar the Niflung and Gudrun his sister, mounts to its end in the murder of Sigurd at the hands of his blood-brothers, the suicide of Brynhild, and the despair of Gudrun. In the Lay of Gudrun her fate after the death of Sigurd is told, her marriage against her will to the mighty Atli, ruler of the Huns (the Attila of history), his murder of her brothers the Niflung lords, and her hideous revenge.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780007317240.jpg,J.

'Propulsive and captivating' Vogue


'Darkly comedic' Daily Mail


Meet Ava: rule-abiding lawyer who has ticked all of life's boxes. She's married to a successful surgeon and has just taken an indefinite career break to raise her adorable toddler. A picture-perfect life.


Meet Winnie: Ava's old college roommate. Once awkward, quiet and apparently academically challenged, she left Stanford in a shroud of scandal. But now, she is charismatic, wealthy and has returned to town dripping in designer accessories. An actual perfect life.


When the two women bump into one another at a local coffee shop, it seems like fate has intervened: Winnie's new-found success is courtesy of a shady business and she needs a favour; Ava is realising she is not built for the stay-at-home life. But what starts as one favour turns into two, then three, and soon Ava is in far deeper than she ever imagined.


Now Ava has to make the ultimate decision: cut and run, or risk it all?

"The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien And Their Friends","The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien And Their Friends


Critically acclaimed, award-winning biography of CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien and the brilliant group of writers to come out of Oxford during the Second World War.


C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and their friends were a regular feature of the Oxford scenery in the years during and after the Second World War. They drank beer on Tuesdays at the 'Bird and Baby', and on Thursday nights they met in Lewis' Magdalen College rooms to read aloud from the books they were writing; jokingly they called themselves 'The Inklings'.


C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien first introduced The Screwtape Letters and The Lord of the Rings to an audience in this company and Charles Williams, poet and writer of supernatural thrillers, was another prominent member of the group.


Humphrey Carpenter, who wrote the acclaimed biography of J.R.R. Tolkien, draws upon unpublished letters and diaries, to which he was given special access, in this engrossing story.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780007748693.jpg,Humphrey Carpenter,Usborne,2012,304,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Literary,https://www.fahasa.com/the-inklings.html
The Road To Middle-earth: How J. R. R. Tolkien Created A New Mythology,"The Road To Middle-earth: How J. R. R. Tolkien Created A New Mythology


The definitive guide to the origin of J.R.R. Tolkien's books, from The Hobbit to The History of Middle-earth series - includes unpublished Tolkien extracts and poetry.


The Road to Middle-Earth is a fascinating and accessible exploration of J.R.R.Tolkien's creativity and the sources of his inspiration. Tom Shippey shows in detail how Tolkien's professional background led him to write The Hobbit and how he created a work of timeless charm for millions of readers. He discusses the contribution of The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales to Tolkien's great myth-cycle, showing how Tolkien's more 'complex' works can be read enjoyably and seriously by readers of his earlier books, and goes on to examine the remarkable 12-volume History of Middle-earth by Tolkien's son and literary heir Christopher Tolkien, which traces the creative and technical processes through which Middle-earth evolved. The core of the book, however, concentrates on The Lord of the Rings as a linguistic and cultural map, as a twisted web of a story, and as a response to the inner meaning of myth and poetry.


By following the routes of Tolkien's own obsessions - the poetry of languages and myth - The Road to Middle-earth shows how Beowulf, The Lord of the Rings, Grimm's Fairy Tales, the Elder Edda and many other works form part of a live and continuing tradition of literature. It takes issue with many basic premises of orthodox criticism and offers a new approach to Tolkien, to fantasy, and to the importance of language in literature.


This new edition is revised and expanded, and includes a previously unpublished lengthy analysis of Peter Jackson's film adaptations and their effect on Tolkien's work.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780261102750.jpg,Tom Shippey,Usborne,2012,432,Tiếng Anh,Fantasy,https://www.fahasa.com/the-road-to-middle-earth.html
The Peoples Of Middle-earth,"The Peoples Of Middle-earth


The concluding volume of The History of Middle-earth series, which examines the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings.


The Peoples of Middle-earth traces the evolution of the Appendices to The Lord of The Rings, which provide a comprehensive historical structure of the Second and Third Ages, including Calendars, Hobbit genealogies and the Westron language. The book concludes with two unique abandoned stories: The New Shadow, set in Gondor during the Fourth Age, and the tale of Tal-elmar, in which the coming of the dreaded Numenorean ships is seen through the eyes of men of Middle-earth in the Dark Years.


With the publication of this book, the long history of J.R.R.

The Cult Of We : Wework And The Great Start-up Delusion,"The Cult Of We : Wework And The Great Start-up Delusion


'An amazing portrait of how grifters came to be called visionaries and high finance lost its mind.' Charles Duhigg, bestselling author of The Power of Habit


The definitive inside story of WeWork, its audacious founder, and the company's epic unravelling from the journalists who first broke the story wide open.


In 2001, Adam Neumann arrived in New York after five years as a conscript in the Israeli navy. Just over fifteen years later, he had transformed himself into the charismatic CEO of a company worth $47 billion. With his long hair and feel-good mantras, the six-foot-five Neumann looked the part of a messianic Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The vision he offered was mesmerizing: a radical reimagining of work space for a new generation. He called it WeWork.


As billions of funding dollars poured in, Neumann's ambitions grew limitless. WeWork wasn't just an office space provider; it would build schools, create cities, even colonize Mars. In pursuit of its founder's vision, the company spent money faster than it could bring it in. From his private jet, sometimes clouded with marijuana smoke, the CEO scoured the globe for more capital but in late 2019, just weeks before WeWork's highly publicized IPO, everything fell apart. Neumann was ousted from his company, but still was poised to walk away a billionaire.


Calling to mind the recent demise of Theranos and the hubris of the dotcom era bust, WeWork's extraordinary rise and staggering implosion were fueled by disparate characters in a financial system blind to its risks. Why did some of the biggest names in banking and venture capital buy the hype? And what does the future hold for Silicon Valley 'unicorns'? Wall Street Journal reporters Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell explore these questions in this definitive, rollicking account of WeWork's boom and bust.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008389406.jpg,"Eliot Brown, Maureen Farrell",Usborne,2022,320,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Business & Industry,https://www.fahasa.com/the-cult-of-we-wework-and-the-great-start-up-delusion.html

Mr Bliss, a man notable for his immensely tall hats and for the girabbit in his garden, takes the whimsical decision to buy a motor car. But his first drive to visit friends quickly becomes a catalogue of disasters.

The Monsters And The Critics,"The Monsters And The Critics


Complete collection of Tolkien's essays, including two on Beowulf, which span three decades beginning six years before The Hobbit to five years after The Lord of the Rings.


The seven 'essays' by J.R.R. Tolkien assembled in this new paperback edition were with one exception delivered as general lectures on particular occasions; and while they mostly arose out of Tolkien's work in medieval literature, they are accessible to all. Two of them are concerned with Beowulf, including the well-known lecture whose title is taken for this book, and one with Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, given in the University of Glasgow in 1953.


Also included in this volume is the lecture English and Welsh; the Valedictory Address to the University of Oxford in 1959; and a paper on Invented Languages delivered in 1931, with exemplification from poems in the Elvish tongues. Most famous of all is On Fairy-Stories, a discussion of the nature of fairy-tales and fantasy, which gives insight into Tolkien's approach to the whole genre.


The pieces in this collection cover a period of nearly thirty years, beginning six years before the publication of The Hobbit, with a unique 'academic' lecture on his invention (calling it A Secret Vice) and concluding with his farewell to professorship, five years after the publication of The Lord of the Rings.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780261102637.jpg,J.

Tales From The Perilous Realm,"Tales From The Perilous Realm


This is the definitive collection of Tolkien's five acclaimed modern classic 'fairie' tales in the vein of The Hobbit, fully corrected and reset for this edition and all beautifully illustrated in pencil by the award-winning artist, Alan Lee.


The five tales are written with the same skill, quality and charm that made The Hobbit a classic. Largely overlooked because of their short lengths, they are finally together in a volume which reaffirms Tolkien's place as a master storyteller for readers young and old.


Roverandom is a toy dog who, enchanted by a sand sorcerer, gets to explore the world and encounter strange and fabulous creatures.


Farmer Giles of Ham is fat and unheroic, but - having unwittingly managed to scare off a short-sighted giant - is called upon to do battle when a dragon comes to town;


The Adventures of Tom Bombadil tells in verse of Tom's many adventures with hobbits, princesses, dwarves and trolls;


Leaf by Niggle recounts the strange adventures of the painter Niggle who sets out to paint the perfect tree;


Smith of Wootton Major journeys to the Land of Faery thanks to the magical ingredients of the Great Cake of the Feast of Good Children.


This new collection is fully illustrated throughout by Oscar-winning artist, Alan Lee, who provides a wealth of pencil drawings to bring the stories to life as he did so memorably for The Hobbit and The Children of Hurin. Alan also provides an Afterword, in which he opens the door into illustrating Tolkien's world.


Taken together, this rich collection of tales from the author of The Children of Hurin will provide the reader with a fascinating journey into lands as wild and strange as Middle-earth.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008453343.jpg,J.

The Lay Of Aotrou And Itroun,"The Lay Of Aotrou And Itroun


Unavailable for more than 70 years, this early but important work is published for the first time with Tolkien's 'Corrigan' poems and other supporting material, including a prefatory note by Christopher Tolkien.


Set 'In Britain's land beyond the seas' during the Age of Chivalry, The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun tells of a childless Breton Lord and Lady (the 'Aotrou' and 'Itroun' of the title) and the tragedy that befalls them when Aotrou seeks to remedy their situation with the aid of a magic potion obtained from a corrigan, or malevolent fairy. When the potion succeeds and Itroun bears twins, the corrigan returns seeking her fee, and Aotrou is forced to choose between betraying his marriage and losing his life.


Coming from the darker side of J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination, The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun, together with the two shorter 'Corrigan' poems that lead up to it and which are also included, was the outcome of a comparatively short but intense period in Tolkien's life when he was deeply engaged with Celtic, and particularly Breton, myth and legend.


Originally written in 1930 and long out of print, this early but seminal work is an important addition to the non-Middle-earth portion of his canon and should be set alongside Tolkien's other retellings of myth and legend, The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun, The Fall of Arthur and The Story of Kullervo. Like these works, it belongs to a small but important corpus of his ventures into 'real-world' mythologies, each of which in its own way would be a formative influence on his own legendarium.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008202132.jpg,J.

Finn And Hengest,"Finn And Hengest


Tolkien's famous translations and lectures on the story of two fifth-century heroes in northern Europe.


Professor J.R.R.Tolkien is most widely known as the author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, but he was also a distinguished scholar in the field of Mediaeval English language and literature. His most significant contribution to Anglo-Saxon studies is to be found in his lectures on Finn and Hengest (pronounced Hen-jist), two fifth-century heroes in northern Europe.


The story is told in two Old English poems, Beowulf and The Fights at Finnesburg, but told so obscurely and allusively that its interpretation had been a matter of controversy for over 100 years. Bringing his unique combination of philological erudition and poetic imagination to the task, however, Tolkien revealed a classic tragedy of divided loyalties, of vengeance, blood and death.


Tolkien's original and persuasive solution of the many problems raised by the story ranged widely through the early history and legend of the Germanic peoples. The story has the added attraction that it describes the events immediately preceding the first Germanic invasion of Britain which was led by Hengest himself.


This book will be of interest not only to students of Old English and all those interested in the history of northern Europe and Anglo-Saxon England, but also admirers of The Lord of the Rings who will be fascinated to see how Tolkien handled a story which he did not invent.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780261103559.jpg,J.

The Nature Of Middle-earth,"The Nature Of Middle-earth


First ever publication of J.R.R. Tolkien's final writings on Middle-earth, covering a wide range of subjects and perfect for those who have read and enjoyed The Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings, Unfinished Tales, and The History of Middle-earth, and want to learn more about Tolkien's magnificent world.


It is well known that J.R.R. Tolkien published The Hobbit in 1937 and The Lord of the Rings in 1954-5. What may be less known is that he continued to write about Middle-earth in the decades that followed, right up until the years before his death in 1973.


For him, Middle-earth was part of an entire world to be explored, and the writings in The Nature of Middle-earth reveal the journeys that he took as he sought to better understand his unique creation. From sweeping themes as complex and profound as the metaphysics of Elvish immortality and reincarnation, and the Powers of the Valar, to the more earth-bound subjects of the lands and beasts of Numenor, the geography of the Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor, and even who had beards!


This new collection, which has been edited by Carl F Hostetter, one of the world's leading Tolkien experts, is a veritable treasure-trove offering readers a chance to peer over Professor Tolkien's shoulder at the very moment of discovery: and on every page, Middle-earth is once again brought to extraordinary life.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008387921.jpg,J.

The Lord Of The Rings: A Reader's Companion,"The Lord Of The Rings: A Reader's Companion


A unique companion to The Lord of the Rings which relates the textual history of the Nation's Favourite Read; with a previously unpublished Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings, written by Tolkien himself.


In The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion internationally acclaimed scholars Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull examine Tolkien's masterpiece chapter by chapter, offering expert insights into its evolution, structure, and meaning. They discuss important influences on its development, connections between that work and other writings by Tolkien, errors and inconsistencies, significant changes to the text, and archaic and unusual words used by Tolkien. Thousands of notes, keyed to standard editions of The Lord of the Rings but universally accessible, reveal the richness and complexity of one of the most popular works of fiction in our time.


Extensive reference is made also to writings by Tolkien not previously or widely published, including elaborate time-schemes, an unfinished manuscript index to The Lord of the Rings, and most notably, the important Nomenclature or guide to names in The Lord of the Rings prepared for the use of translators, long out of print and now newly transcribed and printed in its entirety.


With these resources at hand, even the most seasoned reader of The Lord of the Rings will come to a greater enjoyment and appreciation of Tolkien's magnificent achievement.


Published originally in 2005, the Reader's Companion won the annual Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inkling Studies. It has now been revised and updated to mark the 60th anniversary of The Lord of the Rings.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780007556908.jpg,"Wayne G.

In the first section of Sauron Defeated Christopher Tolkien completes his fascinating study of The Lord of the Rings.

The second section is an edition of The Notion Club Papers. These mysterious papers, discovered in the early years of the twenty-first century, report the discussions of an Oxford club in the years 1986-7, in which after a number of topics, the centre of interest turns to the legend of Atlantis, the strange communications received by other members of the club from the past, and the violent irruption of the legend into the North-west of Europe.

Building on the story begun in The Hobbit, this is the second part of Tolkien's epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, featuring a striking black cover based on Tolkien's own design, the definitive text, and a detailed map of Middle-earth.


Frodo and the Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in the battle with an evil spirit in the Mines of Moria; and at the Falls of Rauros, Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape the rest of the company were attacked by Orcs.

The Lost Road : And Other Writings,"The Lost Road : And Other Writings


The fifth volume of the History of Middle-earth, containing the early myths and legends which led to the writing of Tolkien's epic tale of war, The Silmarillion.


At the end of 1937, J R R Tolkien reluctantly set aside his work on the myths and heroic legends of Valinor and Middle-earth and began The Lord of the Rings.


This fifth volume of The History of Middle-earth completes the examination of his writing up to that time. Later forms of The Annals of Valinor and The Annals of Beleriand had been composed, The Silmarillion was nearing completion in a greatly amplified form, and a new Map had been made. The legend of the Downfall of Numenor had entered the work, including those central ideas: the World Made Round and the Straight Path into the vanished West. Closely associated with this was the abandoned 'time-travel' story The Lost Road, linking the world of Numenor and Middle-earth with the legends of many other times and peoples.


Also included in this volume is the The Lhammas, as essay on the complex languages and dialects of Middle-earth, and an 'etymological dictionary' containing an extensive account of Elvish vocabularies.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780261102255.jpg,J.

Classic hardback edition of the third volume of The Lord of the Rings, now featuring Tolkien's original unused dust-jacket design. Includes special packaging and the definitive edition of the text, with fold-out maps.


The Companions of the Ring have become involved in separate adventures as the quest continues. Aragorn, revealed as the hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, joined with the Riders of Rohan against the forces of Isengard, and took part in the desperate victory of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin, captured by orcs, escaped into Fangorn Forest and there encountered the Ents.


Gandalf returned, miraculously, and defeated the evil wizard, Saruman. Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo progressed towards Mordor to destroy the Ring, accompanied by Smeagol - Gollum, still obsessed by his 'preciouss'. After a battle with the giant spider, Shelob, Sam left his master for dead; but Frodo is still alive - in the hands of the orcs. And all the time the armies of the Dark Lord are massing.


This classic hardback features Tolkien's original unused dust-jacket design, and its text has been fully restored with almost 400 corrections - with the full co-operation of Christopher Tolkien - making it the definitive version, and as close as possible to the version that J.R.R. Tolkien intended. Also included are the original red and black maps as fold-out sheets, and - for the first time - a fully revised and enlarged index.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780007203567.jpg,J.

The Treason of Isengard continues the account of the creation of The Lord of the Rings started in the earlier volume, The Return of the Shadow.


It races the great expansion of the tale into new lands and peoples south and east of the Misty Mountains: the emerence of Lothlorien, of Ents, of the Riders of Rohan, and of Saruman the White in the fortress of Isengard.


In brief outlines and pencilled drafts dashed down on scraps of paper are seen the first entry of Galadriel, the earliest ideas of the history of Gondor, and the original meeting of Aragorn and Eowyn, its significance destined to be wholly transformed.


The book also contains a full account of the original map which was to be the basis of the emerging geography of Middle-earth.

But on Marty's birthday, Grandad, with a glint in his eye, gifts Marty a very special seed. Grandad hasn't been this excited since he invented the bum scratcher 2000 or thought he'd brewed wonder fuel from rhubarb leaves! The seed grows bigger and bigger, and launches Grandad, Marty and his best friend Gracie on an impossible, wondrous plan fuelled by love, hopes and dreams.

The Misunderstandings Of Charity Brown,"The Misunderstandings Of Charity Brown


Inspired by award-winning author's Elizabeth Laird's own childhood growing up in post-war London, The Misunderstandings of Charity Brown is a classic coming-of-age story, perfect for fans of The Skylarks' War and I Capture the Castle.


Charity Brown's life is about to change - her family have been left a huge, rambling house by a mysterious benefactor, and her parents want to move in and throw open its doors to the needy.


Only recently back from hospital after months of isolation with polio, Charity is over-protected and lonely as the only child still at home. Her family are very religious - her sisters are called Faith and Hope, and her brother Ted is studying to be a preacher - so she's both excited and nervous at the thought of sharing her family and new home with strangers.


It's a recipe for confusion, joy and endless misunderstandings, including with the new neighbours, an Austrian family with a daughter just Charity's age . . .",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781529075649.jpg,Elizabeth Laird,Macmillan Publishers,2022,333,Tiếng Anh,Family,https://www.fahasa.com/the-misunderstandings-of-charity-brown.html

"Something Certain, Maybe","Something Certain, Maybe


Something Certain, Maybe is a powerful novel about first love, friendships and embracing the uncertainty of an unknowable future, from Sara Barnard, winner of the YA Book Prize.


Rosie is ready for her life to begin, because nothing says new life like going to university. After years of waiting and working hard, she's finally on the road that will secure her future.


Except university turns out to be not what she hoped or imagined, and although she's not exactly unhappy – really – she might be a little bit worried that she doesn't really like her course much. Or her flatmates. Or, really . . . anything? But it's normal to be homesick (right?) and everything will have settled in a month or two, and it's totally fine that her friends seem so much happier than she is, and that the doctors don’t seem to know what’s wrong with her mother.


And then she meets Jade, and everything starts to look a little brighter. At least, it does if she’s only looking at Jade.

So when they overhear that Whetstone's mother, and the second harp string, are in imprisoned in the land of the Frost Giants, Whetstone decides that in order to beat Loki, he's going to have to act like a 'proper' hero and leave the thief he used to be behind.

Catwoman is out alone on the prowl one night when KABOOM—an explosion at S.T.A.R. Labs—rouses the other girls from their slumber.

How can we prevent a new pandemic from killing millions of people and devastating the global economy? Can we even hope to accomplish this?


Bill Gates believes the answer is yes, and in this book he lays out clearly and convincingly what the world should have learned from COVID-19 and what all of us can do to ward off another disaster like it. Relying on the shared knowledge of the world’s foremost experts and on his own experience of combating fatal diseases through the Gates Foundation, he first helps us understand the science of infectious diseases. Then he shows us how the nations of the world, working in conjunction with one another and with the private sector, can not only ward off another COVID-like catastrophe but also eliminate all respiratory diseases, including the flu.

The Value Of Everything: Making And Taking In The Global Economy,"The Value Of Everything: Making And Taking In The Global Economy


Modern economies reward activities that extract value rather than create it. This must change to ensure a capitalism that works for us all.


Shortlisted for the FT & McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award


A scathing indictment of our current global financial system, The Value of Everything rigorously scrutinizes the way in which economic value has been accounted and reveals how economic theory has failed to clearly delineate the difference between value creation and value extraction. Mariana Mazzucato argues that the increasingly blurry distinction between the two categories has allowed certain actors in the economy to portray themselves as value creators, while in reality they are just moving around existing value or, even worse, destroying it.


The book uses case studies-from Silicon Valley to the financial sector to big pharma-to show how the foggy notions of value create confusion between rents and profits, reward extractors and creators, and distort the measurements of growth and GDP. In the process, innovation suffers and inequality rises.


The lesson here is urgent and sobering: to rescue our economy from the next inevitable crisis and to foster long-term economic growth, we will need to rethink capitalism, rethink the role of public policy and the importance of the public sector, and redefine how we measure value in our society.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541758247.jpg,Mariana Mazzucato,Hachette Book Group,2020,384,Tiếng Anh,Microeconomics,https://www.fahasa.com/the-value-of-everything-making-and-taking-in-the-global-economy.html

Market Mover: Lessons From A Decade Of Change At NASDAQ,"Market Mover: Lessons From A Decade Of Change At NASDAQ


The former CEO and Chairman of Nasdaq shares insights and lessons learned from one of the world's largest stock exchanges, detailing the company's transformation from a fledgling U.S. equities market to a global financial technology company.


During 2003, the U.S. economy was described by one economist as nervous, anxious, and waiting. In December the Dow had topped 10,000 for the first time in a year and a half, and at year's end the markets were up for the first time since 1999. But in the same year, American troops had moved into Iraq, and corporate boards were cutting CEOs at the slightest signs of trouble.


Amidst this turmoil Robert Greifeld, a former tech entrepreneur from outside the Wall Street bubble, became CEO of Nasdaq, a position he would hold for the next thirteen years. He saw the company through one of the most mercurial economic periods in history: the Bernie Madoff mega-scandal; Facebook's tumultuous and disastrous IPO; Hurricane Sandy's disruption of the world's financial hub; the implosion of America's housing market and the global economic crash that followed, from which we have yet to fully recover. In Market Mover, Bob will write a first-hand account of the most critical moments of his career, with each chapter focusing on a headline-making event and ending with a prescriptive takeaway to impart to his readers.


Now Bob, who stepped aside as Nasdaq's CEO at the end of 2016, is eager to look back at more than a decade of transformational change that occurred on his watch in order to share his insights and lessons with business readers.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781538745120.jpg,Robert Greifeld,Hachette Book Group,2021,304,Tiếng Anh,Internet Guides & Online Services,https://www.fahasa.com/market-mover-lessons-from-a-decade-of-change-at-nasdaq.html
"Not To Scale: How The Small Becomes Large, The Large Becomes Unthinkable, And The Unthinkable Becomes Possible","Not To Scale: How The Small Becomes Large, The Large Becomes Unthinkable, And The Unthinkable Becomes Possible


From research to practical application, Not To Scale explores an influential theory in an accessible way.


The dictionary defines ""scale"" as a range of numbers, used as a system to measure or compare things. We use this concept in every aspect of our lives-it is essential to innovation, helps us weigh options, and shapes our understanding of the impact of our actions.


In Not to Scale, Jamer Hunt investigates the complications of scale in the digital age, highlighting an interesting paradox: We now have a world of information at our fingertips, yet ironically the more informed we have become, the more overwhelmed we feel. The global effects of our daily choices (Paper or plastic? Own or lease? Shop local or buy online?) remain difficult for us to comprehend, and solutions to large-scale national and international issues feel inconceivable.


Hunt explains how these challenges are intimately tied to a new logic of scale and provides readers with survival skills for the twenty-first century. By taking massive problems and shrinking them down to size, we can use scale to effect positive change and adapt to the modern era. Connecting our smallest decisions to the grand scheme of things, Not to Scale is a fascinating and empowering guide to comprehending and navigating the high stakes often obscured from our view.

Leap: How To Thrive In A World Where Everything Can Be Copied,"Leap: How To Thrive In A World Where Everything Can Be Copied


Every business faces the existential threat of competitors producing cheaper copies. Even patent filings, market dominance and financial resources can't shield them from copycats. So what can we do--and, what can we learn from companies that have endured and even prospered for centuries despite copycat competition?


In a book of narrative history and practical strategy, IMD professor of management and innovation Howard Yu shows that succeeding in today's marketplace is no longer just a matter of mastering copycat tactics, companies also need to leap across knowledge disciplines, and to reimagine how a product is made or a service is delivered. This proven tactic can protect a company from being overtaken by new (and often foreign) copycat competitors.


Using riveting case studies of successful leaps and tragic falls, Yu illustrates five principles to success that span a wide range of industries, countries, and eras. Learn about how P&G in the 19th century made the leap from handcrafted soaps and candles to mass production of its signature brand Ivory, leaped into the new fields of consumer psychology and advertising, then leaped again, at the risk of cannibalizing its core product, into synthetic detergents and won with Tide in 1946. Learn about how Novartis and other pharma pioneers stayed ahead by making leaps from chemistry to microbiology to genomics in drug discovery; and how forward-thinking companies, including China's largest social media app--WeChat, Tokyo-based Internet service provider Recruit Holdings, and Illinois-headquartered John Deere are leaping ahead by leveraging the emergence of ubiquitous connectivity, the inexorable rise of intelligent machines, and the rising importance of managerial creativity.


Outlasting competition is difficult; doing so over decades or a century is nearly impossible--unless one leaps. Ultimately, Leap is a manifesto for how pioneering companies can endure and prosper in a world of constant change and inevitable copycats.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541758018.jpg,Howard Yu,Hachette Book Group,2020,352,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/leap-how-to-thrive-in-a-world-where-everything-can-be-copied.html
Tomorrow's Capitalist: My Search For The Soul Of Business,"Tomorrow's Capitalist: My Search For The Soul Of Business


In an era of political and cultural extremism, America’s corporate leaders have emerged as the pragmatic center of a movement for social and economic progress.


The core tenets of a capitalist system that dominated the world for more than a century are being challenged as never before. Narratives about the failures of capitalism, the greed of the 1 percent, and the blindness of corporations to public need have made their mark and are driving change. These aren’t the superficial cosmetic fixes that generated so much cynicism in the past, but a revolution in the way corporations are imagined and run. 


Tomorrow’s Capitalist reveals how corporate CEOs—the ultimate pragmatists—realized that they could lose their “operating license” unless they tackle the fundamental issues of our time: climate, diversity and inclusion, and inequality and workforce opportunity. Responding to their employees and customers who are demanding corporate change, they have taken the lead in establishing the bold new principles of stakeholder capitalism, ensuring that for the first time in more than a half a century it is not just shareholders who have a say in how corporations are run.

The Economists' Hour: How The False Prophets Of Free Markets Fractured Our Society,"The Economists' Hour: How The False Prophets Of Free Markets Fractured Our Society


‘A well-reported and researched history of the ways in which plucky economists helped rewrite policy in America and Europe and across emerging markets.’ The Economist


‘A highly readable, exhilaratingly detailed biographical account.’ Sunday Telegraph


As the post-World War II economic boom began to falter in the late 1960s, a new breed of economists gained influence and power. Over time, their ideas reshaped the modern world, curbing governments, unleashing corporations and hastening globalization.


Their fundamental belief? That governments should stop trying to manage the economy.


Their guiding principle? That markets would deliver steady growth and broad prosperity.


But the economists’ hour failed to deliver on its premise. The single-minded embrace of markets has come at the expense of economic equality, the health of liberal democracy and of future generations. Across the world, from both right and left, the assumptions of the once-dominant school of free-market economic thought are being challenged, as we count the costs as well as the gains of its influence.


In The Economists’ Hour, acclaimed New York Times writer Binyamin Appelbaum provides both a reckoning with the past and a call for a different future.

The Nowhere Office: Reinventing Work And The Workplace Of The Future,"The Nowhere Office: Reinventing Work And The Workplace Of The Future


What has changed in the workplace? Everything.


The traditional office was probably doomed anyway. Then a global shutdown changed everything we thought we knew about work, including where and when it needed to take place. Automation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution have accelerated, and perhaps as much as one third of the world’s permanent workforce will soon become remote. In The Nowhere Office, Julia Hobsbawm offers a strategic and practical guide to navigating this pivotal moment in the history of work and provides lessons for how both employees and employers can adapt.


Hobsbawm draws on her extensive networks in business, academia, and entrepreneurship across  generations to offer new ideas about how to handle hybrid working, as well as provides deep insight into how the way we work is being transformed by larger issues such as community, hierarchy, bias, identity, and security. The Nowhere Office describes a unique moment in the history of work which, if understood and handled correctly, can provide a springboard for the biggest transformational change in the workplace for a century: something better, more meaningful, and more workable for everyone.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541701939.jpg,Julia Hobsbawm,Hachette Book Group,2022,208,Tiếng Anh,Office & Workplace,https://www.fahasa.com/the-nowhere-office-reinventing-work-and-the-workplace-of-the-future.html
Good Economics For Hard Times,"Good Economics For Hard Times


The winners of the Nobel Prize show how economics, when done right, can help us solve the thorniest social and political problems of our day.


Figuring out how to deal with today's critical economic problems is perhaps the great challenge of our time. Much greater than space travel or perhaps even the next revolutionary medical breakthrough, what is at stake is the whole idea of the good life as we have known it.


Immigration and inequality, globalization and technological disruption, slowing growth and accelerating climate change--these are sources of great anxiety across the world, from New Delhi and Dakar to Paris and Washington, DC. The resources to address these challenges are there--what we lack are ideas that will help us jump the wall of disagreement and distrust that divides us. If we succeed, history will remember our era with gratitude; if we fail, the potential losses are incalculable.


In this revolutionary book, renowned MIT economists Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo take on this challenge, building on cutting-edge research in economics explained with lucidity and grace. Original, provocative, and urgent, Good Economics for Hard Times makes a persuasive case for an intelligent interventionism and a society built on compassion and respect. It is an extraordinary achievement, one that shines a light to help us appreciate and understand our precariously balanced world.


In this ambitious, provocative book Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo show how traditional western-centric thinking has failed to explain what is happening to people in a newly globalized world: in short Good Economics has been done badly. This precise but accessible book covers many of the most essential issues of our day--including migration, unemployment, growth, free trade, political polarization, and welfare. Banerjee and Duflo will confound and clarify the presumptions of our times, such as:


- Why migration doesn't follow the law of supply and demand

- Why trade liberalization can drive unemployment up and wages down

- Why macroeconomists like to bend the data to fit the model

- Why nobody can really explain why and when growth happens

- Why economists' assumption that people don't change their minds has made has made polarization worse

- Why quite often it doesn't take a village, especially if the villagers aren't that nice


In doing so, they seek to reclaim this essential terrain, and to offer readers an economist's view of the great issues of the day--one that is candid about the complexities, the zones of ignorance, and the areas of genuine disagreement.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541788947.jpg,"Abhijit V.

Overheated: How Capitalism Broke The Planet - And How We Fight Back,"Overheated: How Capitalism Broke The Planet - And How We Fight Back


In the past few years, it has become impossible (for most) to deny the effects of climate change and that the planet is warming, and to acknowledge that we must act. But a new kind of denialism is taking root in the halls of power, shaped by a quarter-century of neoliberal policies, that threatens to doom us before we've grasped the full extent of the crisis.


As Kate Aronoff argues, since the 1980s and 1990s, economists, pro-business Democrats and Republicans in the US, and global organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum have all made concessions to the oil and gas industry that they have no intention of reversing. What's more, they believe that climate change can be solved through the market, capitalism can be a force for good, and all of us, corporations included, are fighting the good fight together.


These assumptions, Aronoff makes abundantly clear, will not save the planet. Drawing on years of reporting and rigorous economic analysis, Aronoff lays out a robust vision for what will, detailing how to constrain the fossil fuel industry; transform the economy into a sustainable, democratic one; mobilize political support; create effective public-private partnerships; enact climate reparations; and adapt to inevitable warming in a way that is just and equitable.


Our future, Aronoff's book makes clear, will require a radical reimagining of our politics and our economies, but if done right, it will save the world.


Aronoff's bold political & economic agenda for saving the world in 12 years includes:


* decarbonizing the economy

* nationalizing utilities and the fossil fuel industry

* public sector - private sector partnerships in the public interest

* a jobs guarantee

* climate reparations

* equitable planning for inevitable warming

* low-carbon luxury",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541700468.jpg,Kate Aronoff,Hachette Book Group,2021,432,Tiếng Anh,Environment,https://www.fahasa.com/overheated-how-capitalism-broke-the-planet-and-how-we-fight-back.html

Corporate boards are under great pressure.

is a searing expose on the booming gold mining industry and destruction on the land and people of Latin America. It looks closely at a small US firm in Miami that helped transform the city into the nation's No.1 importer of gold into the United States.


The book follows the meteoric rise and fall of a group of drug traders known as 'the three amigos' who laundered narco money through gold illegally brought into the US and raked in millions before they were caught.

A Question Of Power: Electricity And The Wealth Of Nations,"A Question Of Power: Electricity And The Wealth Of Nations


Historically, it was guns, germs, and steel that determined the fates of people and nations. Now, more than ever, it is electricity.


Global demand for power is doubling every two decades, but electricity remains one of the most difficult forms of energy to supply and do so reliably. Today, some three billion people live in places where per-capita electricity use is less than what's used by an average American refrigerator. How we close the colossal gap between the electricity rich and the electricity poor will determine our success in addressing issues like women's rights, inequality, and climate change.


In A Question of Power, veteran journalist Robert Bryce tells the human story of electricity, the world's most important form of energy. Through onsite reporting from India, Iceland, Lebanon, Puerto Rico, New York, and Colorado, he shows how our cities, our money--our very lives--depend on reliable flows of electricity. He highlights the factors needed for successful electrification and explains why so many people are still stuck in the dark.


With vivid writing and incisive analysis, he powerfully debunks the notion that our energy needs can be met solely with renewables and demonstrates why--if we are serious about addressing climate change--nuclear energy must play a much bigger role.


Electricity has fueled a new epoch in the history of civilization. A Question of Power explains how that happened and what it means for our future.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541757141.jpg,Robert Bryce,Hachette Book Group,2020,352,Tiếng Anh,Energy Industries & Utilities,https://www.fahasa.com/a-question-of-power-electricity-and-the-wealth-of-nations.html
Alien Thinking,"Alien Thinking


How do people come up with truly original ideas? The answer is to think outside the box--way outside.


For the past decade, Cyril Bouquet, Jean-Louis Barsoux, and Michael Wade, professors of innovation and strategy at IMD Business School, have studied inventors, scientists, doctors, entrepreneurs, and artists. These people, or ""aliens,"" as the authors call them, are able to make leaps of creativity, and use five patterns of thinking that distinguish them from the rest of us.


These five patterns--Attention, Levitation, Imagination, Experimentation, and Navigation--lead to a fresh and flexible approach to problem-solving. Alien thinkers know how to free the imagination so it can detect hard-to-observe patterns. They practice deliberate ways to retreat from the world in order to see the big picture underlying a problem. And they approach ideas in systematic ways that reflect the constraints of reality.


Through surprising and compelling stories, the authors show how readers can use this method to develop out-of-this-world ideas. ALIEN Thinking can help any of us find innovative solutions to the most difficult problems.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541700482.jpg,"Cyril Bouquet, Jean-Louis Barsoux, Michael Wade",Hachette Book Group,2021,292,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/alien-thinking.html
Tarzan Economics,"Tarzan Economics


Taking the lessons learned from his years studying the rise and fall of the modern music industry, Spotify's Chief Economist has crafted ""a compelling and generous read"" (Scott Galloway) that provides the tools to recognize and adapt to disruption in any industry.


As the chief economist at Spotify, Will Page has had the best seat in the house for witnessing--and harnessing--the power of disruptive change. Music has often been the canary in the coal mine for major technological and societal shifts, and if there's one thing Page learned from the digital revolution, it's that businesses must be ready to pivot.


Drawing practical lessons from a variety of fresh case studies covering Radiohead, Starbucks, and even Groucho Marx, Page examines the eight principles that disruption has thrown into sharp relief as keys to survival in any sector. Businesses need to be ready and willing to change and, if necessary, be prepared to rebuild entire organizations and business models to do so. Pivoting through disruption has everything to do with being able to see the revolutionary changes around the corner, recognizing your strengths, and having the confidence to let go of the old vine of doing business and grab onto the new.


A rare book of economics offering actionable takeaways in easy-to-understand language, Tarzan Economics is the must-read book for anyone staring at their own Napster moment and wishing they knew how to fail-safe their business.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780316366397.jpg,Will Page,Hachette Book Group,2021,324,Tiếng Anh,"Media, Information & Communication Industries",https://www.fahasa.com/tarzan-economics.html
"Beyond Great: Nine Strategies For Thriving In An Era Of Social Tension, Economic Nationalism, And Technological Revolution","Beyond Great: Nine Strategies For Thriving In An Era Of Social Tension, Economic Nationalism, And Technological Revolution


Great is no longer good enough. Beyond Great delivers a powerful new playbook of 9 core strategies to thrive in a post-COVID world where all the rules of the game are being re-written.


Beyond Great answers to two fundamental questions which face business leaders today in a world shaped by daunting and disruptive technological, economic, and social change. First, what is outstanding performance in this new volatile era?  Second, how do we build competitive advantage in a world with new and often uncertain rules? Supported by years of research and hands-on consulting practice, this book presents a comprehensive framework for building a high performing, resilient, adaptive, and socially responsible global company.


The book begins by taking an incisive look at these disruptive forces transforming globalization, including economic nationalism; the boom in data flows and digital commerce; the rise of China; heightened public concerns about capitalism and the environment; and the emergence of borderless communities of digitally connected consumers. Distilled from the study of hundreds of companies and interviews with dozens of business leaders, the authors have distilled nine core strategies – the new winning playbook of the 21st century.


Beyond Great argues that business leaders today must lead with a new kind of openness, flexibility and light-footedness, constantly layering in new strategies and operational norms atop existing ones to allow for ""always-on"" transformation. Leaders must master a whole new set of rules about what it takes to be ""global,"" becoming shapeshifters adept at handling contradiction, multiplicity, and nuance.

Intangibles: Unlocking The Science And Soul Of Team Chemistry,"Intangibles: Unlocking The Science And Soul Of Team Chemistry


From baseball to biology, an award-winning journalist highlights the power of team chemistry in this “terrific” data-driven investigation of human relationships (Billie Jean King).


Does team chemistry actually exist? Is there scientific or mathematical proof? Is team chemistry as real and relevant as on-base percentages and wins above replacement?


In Joan Ryan’s groundbreaking book we discover that the answer to all of the above is a resounding yes. As Ryan puts it, team chemistry, or the combination of biological and social forces that boosts selfless effort among more players over more days of a season, is what drives sports teams toward a common goal, encouraging the players to be the best versions of themselves. These are the elements of teams that make them “click,” the ones that foster trust and respect, and push players to exceed their own potential when they work well together.


Team chemistry alone won’t win a World Series, but talent alone won’t win it, either. And by interviewing more than 100 players, coaches, managers, and statisticians, as well as over five years of extensive research in neuroscience, biology, physiology, and psychology, Ryan proves that the social and emotional state of a team does affect performance. Grit, passion, selflessness, and effort matter — but never underestimate the power of chemistry.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780316497152.jpg,Joan Ryan,Hachette Book Group,2020,263,Tiếng Anh,Baseball,https://www.fahasa.com/intangibles-unlocking-the-science-and-soul-of-team-chemistry.html

The story of the idealists, technologists, and opportunists fighting to bring cryptocurrency to the masses.


In their short history, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gone through booms, busts, and internecine wars, recently reaching a market valuation of more than $2 trillion. The central promise of crypto endures—vast fortunes made from decentralized networks not controlled by any single entity and not yet regulated by many governments.


The recent growth of crypto would have been all but impossible if not for a brilliant young man named Vitalik Buterin and his creation: Ethereum. In this book, Laura Shin takes readers inside the founding of this novel cryptocurrency network, which enabled users to launch their own new coins, thus creating a new crypto fever. She introduces readers to larger-than-life characters like Buterin, the Web3 wunderkind; his short-lived CEO, Charles Hoskinson; and Joe Lubin, a former Goldman Sachs VP who became one of crypto’s most well-known billionaires. Sparks fly as these outsized personalities fight for their piece of a seemingly limitless new business opportunity.


This fascinating book shows the crypto market for what it really is: a deeply personal struggle to influence the coming revolution in money, culture, and power.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541763012.jpg,Laura Shin,Hachette Book Group,2022,476,Tiếng Anh,Computer Science,https://www.fahasa.com/the-cryptopians-idealism-greed-lies-and-the-making-of-the-first-big-cryptocurrency-craze.html

"Diversity, Inc.: The Fight For Racial Equality In The Workplace","Diversity, Inc.: The Fight For Racial Equality In The Workplace


One of Time Magazine's Must-Read Books of 2019: An award-winning journalist shows how workplace diversity initiatives have turned into a profoundly misguided industry—and have done little to bring equality to America's major industries and institutions.


Diversity has become the new buzzword, championed by elite institutions from academia to Hollywood to corporate America. In an effort to ensure their organizations represent the racial and ethnic makeup of the country, industry and foundation leaders have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to commission studies, launch training sessions, and hire consultants and diversity czars. But is it working?


In Diversity, Inc., award-winning journalist Pamela Newkirk shines a bright light on the diversity industry, asking the tough questions about what has been effective—and why progress has been so slow. Newkirk highlights the rare success stories, sharing valuable lessons about how other industries can match those gains. But as she argues, despite decades of handwringing, costly initiatives, and uncomfortable conversations, organizations have, apart from a few exceptions, fallen far short of their goals.


Diversity, Inc. incisively shows the vast gap between the rhetoric of inclusivity and real achievements. If we are to deliver on the promise of true equality, we need to abandon ineffective, costly measures and commit ourselves to combatting enduring racial attitudes.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781568588254.jpg,Pamela Newkirk,Hachette Book Group,2020,288,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/diversity-inc-the-fight-for-racial-equality-in-the-workplace.html
The Big Nine: How The Tech Titans And Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity,"The Big Nine: How The Tech Titans And Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity


A call-to-arms about the broken nature of artificial intelligence, and the powerful corporations that are turning the human-machine relationship on its head.


We like to think that we are in control of the future of ""artificial"" intelligence. The reality, though, is that we -- the everyday people whose data powers AI -- aren't actually in control of anything. When, for example, we speak with Alexa, we contribute that data to a system we can't see and have no input into -- one largely free from regulation or oversight. The big nine corporations -- Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, Microsoft, IBM and Apple--are the new gods of AI and are short-changing our futures to reap immediate financial gain.


In this book, Amy Webb reveals the pervasive, invisible ways in which the foundations of AI -- the people working on the system, their motivations, the technology itself -- is broken. Within our lifetimes, AI will, by design, begin to behave unpredictably, thinking and acting in ways which defy human logic. The big nine corporations may be inadvertently building and enabling vast arrays of intelligent systems that don't share our motivations, desires, or hopes for the future of humanity.


Much more than a passionate, human-centered call-to-arms, this book delivers a strategy for changing course, and provides a path for liberating us from algorithmic decision-makers and powerful corporations.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541773738.jpg,Amy Webb,Hachette Book Group,2020,336,Tiếng Anh,Human-computer Interaction,https://www.fahasa.com/the-big-nine-how-the-tech-titans-and-their-thinking-machines-could-warp-humanity-408303.html
Super Founders: What Data Reveals About Billion-Dollar Startups,"Super Founders: What Data Reveals About Billion-Dollar Startups


Super Founders uses a data-driven approach to understand what really differentiates billion-dollar startups from the rest—revealing that nearly everything we thought was true about them is false!


Ali Tamaseb has spent thousands of hours manually amassing what may be the largest dataset ever collected on startups, comparing billion-dollar startups with those that failed to become one—30,000 data points on nearly every factor: number of competitors, market size, the founder’s age, his or her university’s ranking, quality of investors, fundraising time, and many, many more. And what he found looked far different than expected. Just to mention a few:


- Most unicorn founders had no industry experience;

- There's no disadvantage to being a solo founder or to being a non-technical CEO;

- Less than 15% went through any kind of accelerator program;

- Over half had strong competitors when starting--being first to market with an idea does not actually matter.


You will also hear the stories of the early days of billion-dollar startups first-hand. The book includes exclusive interviews with the founders/investors of Zoom, Instacart, PayPal, Nest, Github, Flatiron Health, Kite Pharma, Facebook, Stripe, Airbnb, YouTube, LinkedIn, Lyft, DoorDash, Coinbase, and Square, venture capital investors like Elad Gil, Peter Thiel, Alfred Lin from Sequoia Capital and Keith Rabois of Founders Fund, as well as previously untold stories about the early days of ByteDance (TikTok), WhatsApp, Dropbox, Discord, DiDi, Flipkart, Instagram, Careem, Peloton, and SpaceX.


Packed with counterintuitive insights and inside stories from people who have built massively successful companies, Super Founders is a paradigm-shifting and actionable guide for entrepreneurs, investors, and anyone interested in what makes a startup successful.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541768420.jpg,Ali Tamaseb,Hachette Book Group,2021,320,Tiếng Anh,Data Capture & Analysis,https://www.fahasa.com/super-founders-what-data-reveals-about-billion-dollar-startups.html

* Adam Grant's # 1 pick of his top 20 books of 2020


* One of 6 Groundbreaking Books of Spring 2020 (according to Malcolm Gladwell, Susan Cain, Dan Pink, and Adam Grant).


A former rocket scientist reveals the habits, ideas, and strategies that will empower you to turn the seemingly impossible into the possible.


Rocket science is often celebrated as the ultimate triumph of technology. But it's not. Rather, it's the apex of a certain thought process -- a way to imagine the unimaginable and solve the unsolvable. It's the same thought process that enabled Neil Armstrong to take his giant leap for mankind, that allows spacecraft to travel millions of miles through outer space and land on a precise spot, and that brings us closer to colonizing other planets.


Fortunately, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to think like one.


In this accessible and practical book, Ozan Varol reveals nine simple strategies from rocket science that you can use to make your own giant leaps in work and life -- whether it's landing your dream job, accelerating your business, learning a new skill, or creating the next breakthrough product. Today, thinking like a rocket scientist is a necessity. We all encounter complex and unfamiliar problems in our lives. Those who can tackle these problems -- without clear guidelines and with the clock ticking -- enjoy an extraordinary advantage.

“If you’re not living on the edge, you’re taking up too much space.” —Jim Whittaker, first American to climb Mt. Everest


A leader’s job—in a radically changing world—is standing on the cliff edge, getting a grip on unfamiliar landscapes, and acquiring the skills for leading the enterprise into new territory. In a world facing the unprecedented challenges of global pandemic and economic distruption, every leader needs to find the edge for leaping across the breach and breaking new ground on the other side.

Triumph over adversity using proven Special Operations habits and mindsets with this inspiring guide from retired Navy SEAL and New York Times bestselling author Jason Redman.


Adversity can often catch you by surprise and leave you struggling with what to do next. What if you could confront any adversity, from the biggest challenges -- the loss of your job, divorce, health issues, bankruptcy -- to normal daily challenges -- a late flight, a disappointing phone call, a missed promotion, a bad day -- and not just survive it, but thrive afterwards?


Redman was horrifically wounded in Iraq in 2007 when he was shot at close range through the face and arm. After 40 surgeries, including extensive facial reconstruction and skin grafts, he came back from this experience stronger than ever -- despite carrying scars and injuries he will have for the rest of his life. Redman went on to launch two successful companies and speaks all over the country on how to build better leaders through his Overcome mindset.


Overcome is based on extensive research and interviews with America's toughest warriors, including retired 4-star Admiral William McRaven, retired Navy SEAL Jocko Willink, retired 4-star General Stanley McChrystal, and others. In this book, Redman teaches:


- How to survive any life ambush

- How to move from defense to offense using the proactive techniques of SEAL teams

- How to strengthen your endurance during long-term trials

- How to rediscover and thrive in your life purpose

- How to lead your team (whether in business or family) to success

A Wall Street Journal bestseller


From the CEO and President of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) comes the ultimate book on transforming the way we select, retain and train our employees in a radically changed business environment.


With the growth of remote work and an increased focus on diversity and inclusion, companies are increasingly finding themselves in “wars for talent” as they source and recruit candidates from all over the world. They need to find new ways to contact people and new sources of talent. They need to create an enduring and tangible culture that helps everyone feel empowered to do their best work.

The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory And The Birth Of The People's Economy,"The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory And The Birth Of The People's Economy


A New York Times Bestseller


The leading thinker and most visible public advocate of modern monetary theory -- the freshest and most important idea about economics in decades -- delivers a radically different, bold, new understanding for how to build a just and prosperous society.


Stephanie Kelton's brilliant exploration of modern monetary theory (MMT) dramatically changes our understanding of how we can best deal with crucial issues ranging from poverty and inequality to creating jobs, expanding health care coverage, climate change, and building resilient infrastructure. Any ambitious proposal, however, inevitably runs into the buzz saw of how to find the money to pay for it, rooted in myths about deficits that are hobbling us as a country.


Kelton busts through the myths that prevent us from taking action: that the federal government should budget like a household, that deficits will harm the next generation, crowd out private investment, and undermine long-term growth, and that entitlements are propelling us toward a grave fiscal crisis.


MMT, as Kelton shows, shifts the terrain from narrow budgetary questions to one of broader economic and social benefits. With its important new ways of understanding money, taxes, and the critical role of deficit spending, MMT redefines how to responsibly use our resources so that we can maximize our potential as a society. MMT gives us the power to imagine a new politics and a new economy and move from a narrative of scarcity to one of opportunity.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541736191.jpg,Stephanie Kelton,Hachette Book Group,2021,352,Tiếng Anh,Macroeconomics,https://www.fahasa.com/the-deficit-myth-modern-monetary-theory-and-the-birth-of-the-people-s-economy.html
What To Expect When You're Expecting Robots: The Future Of Human-robot Collaboration,"What To Expect When You're Expecting Robots: The Future Of Human-robot Collaboration


The next generation of robots will be truly social, but can we make sure that they play well in the sandbox?


Most robots are just tools. They do limited sets of tasks subject to constant human control. But a new type of robot is coming. These machines will operate on their own in busy, unpredictable public spaces. They'll ferry deliveries, manage emergency rooms, even grocery shop. Such systems could be truly collaborative, accomplishing tasks we don't do well without our having to stop and direct them.


This makes them social entities, so, as robot designers Laura Major and Julie Shah argue, whether they make our lives better or worse is a matter of whether they know how to behave.


What to Expect When You're Expecting Robots offers a vision for how robots can survive in the real world and how they will change our relationship to technology. From teaching them manners, to robot-proofing public spaces, to planning for their mistakes, this book answers every question you didn't know you needed to ask about the robots on the way.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541699113.jpg,"Laura Major, Julie Shah",Hachette Book Group,2020,304,Tiếng Anh,Electronics Engineering,https://www.fahasa.com/what-to-expect-when-you-re-expecting-robots-the-future-of-human-robot-collaboration.html

The Rise Of The Creative Class,"The Rise Of The Creative Class


World-renowned urbanist Richard Florida's bestselling classic on the transformation of our cities in the twenty-first century -- now updated with a new preface


In his modern classic The Rise of the Creative Class, urbanist Richard Florida identifies the emergence of a new social class reshaping the twenty-first century's economy, geography, and workplace. This Creative Class is made up of engineers and managers, academics and musicians, researchers, designers, entrepreneurs and lawyers, poets and programmer, whose work turns on the creation of new forms. Increasingly, Florida observes, this Creative Class determines how workplaces are organized, which companies prosper or go bankrupt, and which cities thrive, stagnate or decline.


Florida offers a detailed occupational, demographic, psychological, and economic profile of the Creative Class, examines its global impact, and explores the factors that shape ""quality of place"" in our changing cities and suburbs. Now updated with a new preface that considers the latest developments in our changing cities, The Rise of the Creative Class is the definitive edition of this foundational book on our contemporary economy.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541617742.jpg,Richard Florida,Hachette Book Group,2019,512,Tiếng Anh,Urban Economics,https://www.fahasa.com/the-rise-of-the-creative-class.html
Mastering Community: The Surprising Ways Coming Together Moves Us From Surviving To Thriving,"Mastering Community: The Surprising Ways Coming Together Moves Us From Surviving To Thriving


From the author of Mastering Civility, an illuminating and empowering guide to help you discover just how important thriving communities are to our wellbeing and the success of organizations, and learn what steps you can take to create them


Despite our deep desire to feel a sense of belonging, many of us feel isolated. The rise of technology and modern workplace practices have led people to be even more disconnected, even as we remain constantly contactable. And as our human interactions have decreased, so too have our happiness levels. This is sparking a crisis in mental health that will have repercussions for years, leaving people lonelier and organizations less productive and profitable, too. What Christine Porath has discovered in her research is that leaders, organizations, and managers of all stripes may recognize there is a cost but have few solutions for how to implement the cure: Community.


With her signature depth and grasp of research across myriad industries including business, healthcare, hospitality, and sports, Porath extrapolates from the statistics on the experiences of hundreds of thousands of people across six continents to show us the potential for change. Through uniting people and sharing information, unleashing them with autonomy, creating a respectful environment, practicing radical candor, providing a sense of meaning, and boosting personal well-being, anyone can help a community truly flourish. The applications of Porath’s findings are endless, and the stories and case studies are positive and uplifting. This insightful exploration of the real nature of community-building will inspire readers to unite and grow their communities—be it in the workplace, the PTA, sports, or places of worship—and make them thrive.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781538736869.jpg,Christine Porath,Hachette Book Group,2022,320,Tiếng Anh,Office & Workplace,https://www.fahasa.com/mastering-community-the-surprising-ways-coming-together-moves-us-from-surviving-to-thriving.html
"Broken Windows, Broken Business: The Revolutionary Broken Windows Theory: How The Smallest Remedies Reap The Biggest Rewards","Broken Windows, Broken Business: The Revolutionary Broken Windows Theory: How The Smallest Remedies Reap The Biggest Rewards


Now revised and updated, this ""inspired, impactful, and important"" book shows how to achieve the ultimate success by rectifying the small problems that can sink a business (Stephen R, Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People).


Once every few years a book comes along with an insight so penetrating, so powerful—and so simply, demonstrably true—that it instantly changes the way we think and do business. Such a book is Broken Windows, Broken Business, a breakthrough in management theory that can alter the destiny of countless companies striving to stay ahead of their competition.


In this vital work, author Michael Levine offers compelling evidence that problems in business, large and small, typically stem from inattention to tiny details. Social psychologists and criminologists agree that if a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired, soon thereafter the rest of the windows will be broken—and the perception will build that crime in that neighborhood is out of control. The same principle applies to business.


Drawing on real-world corporate examples, from JetBlue's decision to give fliers what they really want—leather seats, personal televisions, online ticketing - to Google's customer-based strategy for breaking out of the pack of Internet search engines, to business-to-business firms' successes and failures, Levine proves again and again how constant vigilance and an obsession with detail can make or break a business or a brand.


With tips and advice on changing any business to one that dots its i's, crosses its t's, and attracts more clients, Broken Windows, Broken Business goes straight to the heart of what makes all enterprises successful—the little things that mean a lot.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781538719275.jpg,Michael Levine,Hachette Book Group,2021,272,Tiếng Anh,Sales & Marketing,https://www.fahasa.com/broken-windows-broken-business-the-revolutionary-broken-windows-theory-how-the-smallest-remedies-reap-the-biggest-rewards.html

CEO and founder of Moves the Needle and New York Times bestselling author of The Lean Entrepreneur Brant Cooper teaches leaders how to ensure their organizations are resilient, aware, and dynamic enough to endure long-term, weathering the storms of disruption and uncertainty.


One thing in life is certain: change is constant. Thanks to the rapid pace of technological innovation in the digital age—and further accelerated by the global COVID-19 pandemic—massive structural change is happening on a greater scale than ever before. Faced with unprecedented complexity and uncertainty, most business leaders struggle to see the way forward. Company organization, systems, and management are still largely based on what was most effective in the Industrial Age. Disruption Proof offers a new approach that addresses our current reality.


Through powerful case studies of notable corporations like Intuit, 3M, Cargill, and more, Cooper demonstrates how, with the right mindset and practical strategies, companies that focus on creating value for customers can thrive in the 21st century. Disruption Proof provides readers with detailed methods for progressing through four stages of implementation to embrace a new way of working company-wide, including how to:


- develop an understanding of customers and colleagues that lead to insights (empathy)

- run tests to challenge assumptions (exploration)

- leverage data and insights to breakthrough biases (evidence)

- balance operational execution with learning (equilibrium)

- manage behavior to match corporate values (ethics)


By adopting these 5Es, company leaders can empower employees to become creative problem solvers, ensuring their company's ability to navigate moments of crisis and find transformative opportunities.

The Antisocial Network: The Gamestop Short Squeeze And The Ragtag Group Of Amateur Traders That Brought Wall Street To Its Knees,"The Antisocial Network: The Gamestop Short Squeeze And The Ragtag Group Of Amateur Traders That Brought Wall Street To Its Knees


Named a Best Book of the Year by New York Post!


From one of our most innovative and celebrated authors, the definitive take on the wildest story of the year— the David-vs.-Goliath GameStop short squeeze, a tale of fortunes won and lost overnight that may end up changing Wall Street forever.


Bestselling author Ben Mezrich offers a gripping, beat-by-beat account of how a loosely affiliate group of private investors and internet trolls on a subreddit called WallStreetBets took down one of the biggest hedge funds on Wall Street, firing the first shot in a revolution that threatens to upend the establishment.


It’s the story of financial titans like Gabe Plotkin of hedge fund Melvin Capital, one of the most respected and staid funds on the Street, billionaires like Elon Musk, Steve Cohen, Mark Cuban, Robinhood co-CEOs Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, and Ken Griffin of Citadel Securities. Over the course of four incredible days, each in their own way must reckon with a formidable force they barely understand, let alone saw coming: everyday men and women on WallStreetBets like nurse Kim Campbell, college student Jeremy Poe, and the enigmatic Keith “RoaringKitty” Gill, whose unfiltered livestream videos captivated a new generation of stock market enthusiasts.


The unlikely focus of the battle: GameStop, a flailing brick-and-mortar dinosaur catering to teenagers and outsiders that had somehow held on as the world rapidly moved online. At first, WallStreetBets was a joke—a meme-filled, freewheeling place to share shoot-the-moon investment tips, laugh about big losses, and post diamond hand emojis. Until some members noticed an opportunity in GameStop—and rode a rocket ship to tens of millions of dollars in earnings overnight.


In thrilling, pulse-pounding prose, THE ANTISOCIAL NETWORK offers a fascinating, never-before-seen glimpse at the outsize personalities, dizzying swings, corporate drama, and underestimated American heroes and heroines who captivated the nation during one of the most volatile weeks in financial history. It’s the amazing story of what just happened—and where we go from here.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781538707579.jpg,Ben Mezrich,Hachette Book Group,2022,304,Tiếng Anh,Business & Management,https://www.fahasa.com/the-antisocial-network-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-and-the-ragtag-group-of-amateur-traders-that-brought-wall-street-to-its-knees.html

Two of the world's leading experts explain the vital link between health and wealth that could add years to your life and dollars to your retirement savings.


All the money in the world doesn't mean a thing if we can't get out of bed. And the healthiest body in the world won't stay that way if we're frazzled about five figures worth of debt. Today Show financial expert Jean Chatzky and the Cleveland Clinic's chief wellness officer Dr. Michael Roizen explain the vital connection between health and wealth--giving readers all the tactics, strategies, and know-how to live longer, healthier, more lucrative lives.


The same principles that allow us to achieve a better body will allow us to do the same for our investment portfolio. For instance, physical and financial stability comes down to the same equation: Inflow versus outflow. Do we burn more calories than we ingest? Likewise, are we making more money than we spend? The authors detail scientific ways to improve our behavior so that the answers tilt in the readers' favor. They also offer ways to beat the system by automating how we do things and limiting our decisions in the face of too much food or too much debt.

"Lab Rats: Tech Gurus, Junk Science, And Management Fads - My Quest To Make Work Less Miserable","Lab Rats: Tech Gurus, Junk Science, And Management Fads - My Quest To Make Work Less Miserable


New York Times bestselling author Dan Lyons exposes how the ""new oligarchs"" of Silicon Valley have turned technology into a tool for oppressing workers in this ""passionate"" (Kirkus) and ""darkly funny"" (Publishers Weekly) examination of workplace culture.


At a time of soaring corporate profits and plenty of HR lip service about ""wellness,"" millions of workers--in virtually every industry -- are deeply unhappy. Why did work become so miserable? Who is responsible? And does any company have a model for doing it right?


For two years, Lyons ventured in search of answers. From the innovation-crazed headquarters of the Ford Motor Company in Detroit, to a cult-like ""Holocracy"" workshop in San Francisco, and to corporate trainers who specialize in . . . Legos, Lyons immersed himself in the often half-baked and frequently lucrative world of what passes for management science today. He shows how new tools, workplace practices, and business models championed by tech's empathy-impaired power brokers have shattered the social contract that once existed between companies and their employees. These dystopian beliefs--often masked by pithy slogans like ""We're a Team, Not a Family"" -- have dire consequences: millions of workers who are subject to constant change, dehumanizing technologies -- even health risks.


A few companies, however, get it right. With Lab Rats, Lyons makes a passionate plea for business leaders to understand this dangerous transformation, showing how profit and happy employees can indeed coexist.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780316561877.jpg,Dan Lyons,Hachette Book Group,2019,288,Tiếng Anh,Office & Workplace,https://www.fahasa.com/lab-rats-tech-gurus-junk-science-and-management-fads-my-quest-to-make-work-less-miserable.html

A Wall Street Journal Business Bestseller: This ""vivid"" inside story of WeWork and its CEO tells the remarkable saga of one of the most audacious, and improbable, rises and falls in American business history (Ken Auletta).


Christened a potential savior of Silicon Valley's startup culture, Adam Neumann was set to take WeWork, his office share company disrupting the commercial real estate market, public, cash out on the company's forty-seven billion dollar valuation, and break the string of major startups unable to deliver to shareholders. But as employees knew, and investors soon found out, WeWork's capital was built on promises that the company was more than a real estate purveyor, that in fact it was a transformational technology company.


Veteran journalist Reeves Weideman dives deep into WeWork and it CEO's astronomical rise, from the marijuana and tequila-filled board rooms to cult-like company summer camps and consciousness-raising with Anthony Kiedis. Billion Dollar Loser is a character-driven business narrative that captures, through the fascinating psyche of a billionaire founder and his wife and co-founder, the slippery state of global capitalism.

National bestselling author and star of Bravo's Million Dollar Listing and Sell It Like Serhant shows readers how to restructure their approach to money so they can achieve success in business and life.


Big Money Energy is the feeling you get when you encounter someone who is massively succeeding at life. They're the ultimate picture of self-confidence. There's no bravado, no bragging—they know they have BME and so does everyone else. You get Big Money Energy by being 100% committed to making your vision a reality . . . and that vision has to be BIG.


Ten years ago, Ryan Serhant, billion dollar broker and costar of Million Dollar Listing New York was living paycheck-to-paycheck and didn't even own a suit. Serhant realized that while he couldn't change his circumstances or the balance of his bank account, there was one thing he could change—his energy. The energy you give off impacts every area of your life, from how much money you earn and how much power you have, to who you socialize with and the jobs you get.


Determined to leave his low-rent lifestyle behind forever, Serhant took life-changing steps that resulted in his getting cast on television, graduating to seven-figure sales, and doubling his income every year for the next decade. Serhant is now the CEO and Founder of SERHANT., a multi-dimensional real estate brokerage and media company, and averages a billion dollars in sales every year.


In Big Money Energy, Serhant will show readers how he tapped into his Big Money Energy to crush his goals and achieve huge success, earning his first million before he turned thirty. Whether you're a self-made entrepreneur, a corporate executive or barista, Serhant will teach you how to climb the ladder to success better and faster than anyone else.


If you want Big Money Energy, this is your blueprint. This book is an inspirational, lively guide for anyone who is ambitious enough to dream big and is committed to doing whatever it takes to conquer them.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780306923098.jpg,Ryan Serhant,Hachette Book Group,2022,240,Tiếng Anh,"Assertiveness, Motivation & Self-esteem",https://www.fahasa.com/big-money-energy-how-to-rule-at-work-dominate-at-life-and-make-millions.html
Blood And Oil: Mohammed Bin Salman's Ruthless Quest For Global Power,"Blood And Oil: Mohammed Bin Salman's Ruthless Quest For Global Power


From award-winning Wall Street Journal reporters comes a revelatory look at the inner workings of the world's most powerful royal family, and how the struggle for succession produced Saudi Arabia's charismatic but ruthless Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS.​


35-year-old Mohammed bin Salman's sudden rise stunned the world. Political and business leaders such as former UK prime minister Tony Blair and WME chairman Ari Emanuel flew out to meet with the crown prince and came away convinced that his desire to reform the kingdom was sincere. He spoke passionately about bringing women into the workforce and toning down Saudi Arabia's restrictive Islamic law. He lifted the ban on women driving and explored investments in Silicon Valley.


But MBS began to betray an erratic interior beneath the polish laid on by scores of consultants and public relations experts like McKinsey & Company. The allegations of his extreme brutality and excess began to slip out, including that he ordered the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. While stamping out dissent by holding 300 people, including prominent members of the Saudi royal family, in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and elsewhere for months, he continued to exhibit his extreme wealth, including buying a $70 million chateau in Europe and one of the world's most expensive yachts. It seemed that he did not understand nor care about how the outside world would react to his displays of autocratic muscle—what mattered was the flex.


Blood and Oil is a gripping work of investigative journalism about one of the world's most decisive and dangerous new leaders. Hope and Scheck show how MBS' precipitous rise coincided with the fraying of the simple bargain that had been at the head of US-Saudi relations for more than 80 years: oil, for military protection. Caught in his net are well-known US bankers, Hollywood figures, and politicians, all eager to help the charming and crafty crown prince.


The Middle East is already a volatile region. Add to the mix an ambitious prince with extraordinary powers, hunger for lucre, a tight relationship with the White House through President Trump's son in law Jared Kushner, and an apparent willingness to break anything—and anyone—that gets in the way of his vision, and the stakes of his rise are bracing. If his bid fails, Saudi Arabia has the potential to become an unstable failed state and a magnet for Islamic extremists. And if his bid to transform his country succeeds, even in part, it will have reverberations around the world.

The Emissary
 meets 
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime
 in this poignant and triumphant story about how love, friendship, and persistence can change a life forever.


This story is, in short, about a monster meeting another monster. 


One of the monsters is me.


Yunjae was born with a brain condition called Alexithymia that makes it hard for him to feel emotions like fear or anger. He does not have friends—the two almond-shaped neurons located deep in his brain have seen to that—but his devoted mother and grandmother provide him with a safe and content life. Their little home above his mother’s used bookstore is decorated with colorful Post-it notes that remind him when to smile, when to say ""thank you,"" and when to laugh.


Then on Christmas Eve—Yunjae’s sixteenth birthday—everything changes. A shocking act of random violence shatters his world, leaving him alone and on his own. Struggling to cope with his loss, Yunjae retreats into silent isolation, until troubled teenager Gon arrives at his school, and they develop a surprising bond.


As Yunjae begins to open his life to new people—including a girl at school—something slowly changes inside him. And when Gon suddenly finds his life at risk, Yunjae will have the chance to step outside of every comfort zone he has created to perhaps become the hero he never thought he would be.


Readers of 
Wonder 
by R.J. Palaccio and 
Ginny Moon
 by Benjamin Ludwig will appreciate this ""resonant"" story that ""gives Yunjae the courage to claim an entirely different story."" (

A Caribbean Heiress In Paris,"A Caribbean Heiress In Paris


Entertainment Weekly’s Best Romance Book of 2022 so far!


""Herrera excels at propelling the romance genre and its form forward, and this book is no exception... Herrera is crafting swoony historical romances that aren't afraid to engage with the realities of the 19th-century while still making a bid for hard-earned happily-ever-afters.""—Entertainment Weekly


""A romp-filled and refreshingly diverse historical romance.""—Buzzfeed


Paris, 1889


The Exposition Universelle is underway, drawing merchants from every corner of the globe…including Luz Alana Heith-Benzan, heiress to the Caña Brava rum empire.


Luz Alana set sail from Santo Domingo armed with three hundred casks of rum, her two best friends and one simple rule: under no circumstances is she to fall in love. In the City of Lights, she intends to expand the rum business her family built over three generations, but buyers and shippers alike can’t imagine doing business with a woman…never mind a woman of color. This, paired with being denied access to her inheritance unless she marries, leaves the heiress in a very precarious position.


Enter James Evanston Sinclair, Earl of Darnick, who has spent a decade looking for purpose outside of his father’s dirty money and dirtier dealings. Ignoring his title, he’s built a whisky brand that’s his biggest—and only—passion. That is, until he’s confronted with a Spanish-speaking force of nature who turns his life upside down.


From their first tempestuous meeting, Luz Alana is conflicted. Why is this titled—and infuriatingly charming—Scottish man so determined to help her?


For Evan, every day with Luz Alana makes him yearn for more than her ardent kisses or the marriage of convenience that might save them both. But Luz Alana sailed for Paris prepared to build her business and her future; what she wasn’t prepared for was love finding her.

The Boardwalk Bookshop: A 2022 Beach Read,"The Boardwalk Bookshop: A 2022 Beach Read


AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES AND USA TODAY BESTSELLER!


""A book begging to be read on the beach, with the sun warming the sand and salt in the air: pure escapism.""—Kirkus


From #1 New York Times bestselling author Susan Mallery comes a book-about-books story of friends who become family, giving each other courage to start over.


When fate brings three strangers to a charming space for lease on the California coast, the Boardwalk Bookshop is born. Part bookstore, part gift shop, part bakery, it's a dream come true for Bree, Mikki and Ashley. But while their business is thriving, their personal lives are…not.


Bree, wounded by brilliant but cold parents and her late husband's ultimate betrayal, has sworn to protect her heart at all costs. Even from Ashley's brother, a writer and adventurer who has inspired millions. He's the first man to see past Bree's barricades to her true self, which terrifies her. Mikki has this divorce thing all figured out—somehow, she's stayed friends with her ex and her in-laws…until a new man changes how everyone looks at her, and how she sees herself. Meanwhile, Ashley discovers that the love of her life never intends to marry. Can she live without being a wife if it means she can have everything else she's ever wanted?


At sunset every Friday on the beach in front of the Boardwalk Bookshop, the three friends share a champagne toast. As their bond grows closer, they challenge one another to become the best versions of themselves in this heartachingly beautiful story of friendship, sisterhood and the transformative power of love.

The Cellist,"The Cellist


#1 New York Times Bestseller


“The pace of “The Cel­list” never slack­ens as its ac­tion vol­leys from Zurich to Tel Aviv to Paris and be­yond. Mr. Silva tells his story with zest, wit and su­perb tim­ing, and he en­gi­neers enough sur­prises to star­tle even the most at­ten­tive reader.“—Wall Street Journal


From Daniel Silva, the internationally acclaimed #1 New York Times bestselling author, comes a timely and explosive new thriller featuring art restorer and legendary spy Gabriel Allon.


Viktor Orlov had a longstanding appointment with death. Once Russia’s richest man, he now resides in splendid exile in London, where he has waged a tireless crusade against the authoritarian kleptocrats who have seized control of the Kremlin. His mansion in Chelsea’s exclusive Cheyne Walk is one of the most heavily protected private dwellings in London. Yet somehow, on a rainy summer evening, in the midst of a global pandemic, Russia’s vengeful president finally manages to cross Orlov’s name off his kill list.


Before him was the receiver from his landline telephone, a half-drunk glass of red wine, and a stack of documents.…


The documents are contaminated with a deadly nerve agent. The Metropolitan Police determine that they were delivered to Orlov’s home by one of his employees, a prominent investigative reporter from the anti-KremlinMoskovskaya Gazeta. And when the reporter slips from London hours after the killing, MI6 concludes she is a Moscow Center assassin who has cunningly penetrated Orlov’s formidable defenses.


But Gabriel Allon, who owes his very life to Viktor Orlov, believes his friends in British intelligence are dangerously mistaken. His desperate search for the truth will take him from London to Amsterdam and eventually to Geneva, where a private intelligence service controlled by a childhood friend of the Russian president is using KGB-style “active measures” to undermine the West from within. Known as the Haydn Group, the unit is plotting an unspeakable act of violence that will plunge an already divided America into chaos and leave Russia unchallenged. Only Gabriel Allon, with the help of a brilliant young woman employed by the world’s dirtiest bank, can stop it.


Elegant and sophisticated, provocative and daring, The Cellist explores one of the preeminent threats facing the West today—the corrupting influence of dirty money wielded by a revanchist and reckless Russia. It is at once a novel of hope and a stark warning about the fragile state of democracy. And it proves once again why Daniel Silva is regarded as his generation’s finest writer of suspense and international intrigue.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780062835093.jpg,Daniel Silva,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,496,Tiếng Anh,Thrillers,https://www.fahasa.com/the-cellist.html

The One Device: The Secret History Of The Iphone,"The One Device: The Secret History Of The Iphone


The secret history of the invention that changed everything-and became the most profitable product in the world.


""The One Device is a tour de force, with a fast-paced edge and heaps of analytical insight.""-Ashlee Vance, New York Times bestselling author of Elon Musk


""A stunning book. You will never look at your iPhone the same way again."" -Dan Lyons, New York Times bestselling author of Disrupted


Odds are that as you read this, an iPhone is within reach. But before Steve Jobs introduced us to ""the one device,"" as he called it, a cell phone was merely what you used to make calls on the go.


How did the iPhone transform our world and turn Apple into the most valuable company ever? Veteran technology journalist Brian Merchant reveals the inside story you won't hear from Cupertino-based on his exclusive interviews with the engineers, inventors, and developers who guided every stage of the iPhone's creation.


This deep dive takes you from inside One Infinite Loop to 19th century France to WWII America, from the driest place on earth to a Kenyan pit of toxic e-waste, and even deep inside Shenzhen's notorious ""suicide factories."" It's a firsthand look at how the cutting-edge tech that makes the world work-touch screens, motion trackers, and even AI-made their way into our pockets.


The One Device is a roadmap for design and engineering genius, an anthropology of the modern age, and an unprecedented view into one of the most secretive companies in history.

"Move Fast And Break Things: How Facebook, Google, And Amazon Cornered Culture And Undermined Democracy","Move Fast And Break Things: How Facebook, Google, And Amazon Cornered Culture And Undermined Democracy


The book that started the Techlash.


A stinging polemic that traces the destructive monopolization of the Internet by Google, Facebook and Amazon, and that proposes a new future for musicians, journalists, authors and filmmakers in the digital age.


Move Fast and Break Things is the riveting account of a small group of libertarian entrepreneurs who in the 1990s began to hijack the original decentralized vision of the Internet, in the process creating three monopoly firms -- Facebook, Amazon, and Google -- that now determine the future of the music, film, television, publishing and news industries.


Jonathan Taplin offers a succinct and powerful history of how online life began to be shaped around the values of the men who founded these companies, including Peter Thiel and Larry Page: overlooking piracy of books, music, and film while hiding behind opaque business practices and subordinating the privacy of individual users in order to create the surveillance-marketing monoculture in which we now live.


The enormous profits that have come with this concentration of power tell their own story. Since 2001, newspaper and music revenues have fallen by 70 percent; book publishing, film, and television profits have also fallen dramatically. Revenues at Google in this same period grew from $400 million to $74.5 billion. Today, Google's YouTube controls 60 percent of all streaming-audio business but pay for only 11 percent of the total streaming-audio revenues artists receive. More creative content is being consumed than ever before, but less revenue is flowing to the creators and owners of that content.


The stakes here go far beyond the livelihood of any one musician or journalist. As Taplin observes, the fact that more and more Americans receive their news, as well as music and other forms of entertainment, from a small group of companies poses a real threat to democracy.


Move Fast and Break Things offers a vital, forward-thinking prescription for how artists can reclaim their audiences using knowledge of the past and a determination to work together. Using his own half-century career as a music and film producer and early pioneer of streaming video online, Taplin offers new ways to think about the design of the World Wide Web and specifically the way we live with the firms that dominate it.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780316275750.jpg,Jonathan Taplin,Hachette Book Group,2018,320,Tiếng Anh,E-commerce: Business Aspects,https://www.fahasa.com/move-fast-and-break-things-how-facebook-google-and-amazon-cornered-culture-and-undermined-democracy-405926.html
The Smartest Places On Earth: Why Rustbelts Are The Emerging Hotspots Of Global Innovation,"The Smartest Places On Earth: Why Rustbelts Are The Emerging Hotspots Of Global Innovation


The remarkable story of how rustbelt cities such as Akron and Albany in the United States and Eindhoven in Europe are becoming the unlikely hotspots of global innovation, where sharing brainpower and making things smarter -- not cheaper -- is creating a new economy that is turning globalization on its head


Antoine van Agtmael and Fred Bakker counter recent conventional wisdom that the American and northern European economies have lost their initiative in innovation and their competitive edge by focusing on an unexpected and hopeful trend: the emerging sources of economic strength coming from areas once known as ""rustbelts"" that had been written off as yesterday's story.


In these communities, a combination of forces -- visionary thinkers, local universities, regional government initiatives, start-ups, and big corporations -- have created ""brainbelts."" Based on trust, a collaborative style of working, and freedom of thinking prevalent in America and Europe, these brainbelts are producing smart products that are transforming industries by integrating IT, sensors, big data, new materials, new discoveries, and automation. From polymers to medical devices, the brainbelts have turned the tide from cheap, outsourced production to making things smart right in our own backyard.

The End Of Loyalty: The Rise And Fall Of Good Jobs In America,"The End Of Loyalty: The Rise And Fall Of Good Jobs In America


Having a good, stable job used to be the bedrock of the American Dream. Not anymore.


In this richly detailed and eye-opening book, Rick Wartzman chronicles the erosion of the relationship between American companies and their workers. Through the stories of four major employers -- General Motors, General Electric, Kodak, and Coca-Cola -- he shows how big businesses once took responsibility for providing their workers and retirees with an array of social benefits. At the height of the post-World War II economy, these companies also believed that worker pay needed to be kept high in order to preserve morale and keep the economy humming. Productivity boomed.


But the corporate social contract didn't last. By tracing the ups and downs of these four corporate icons over seventy years, Wartzman illustrates just how much has been lost: job security and steadily rising pay, guaranteed pensions, robust health benefits, and much more. Charting the Golden Age of the '50s and '60s; the turbulent years of the '70s and '80s; and the growth of downsizing, outsourcing, and instability in the modern era, Wartzman's narrative is a biography of the American Dream gone sideways.


Deeply researched and compelling, The End of Loyalty will make you rethink how Americans can begin to resurrect the middle class.

The Signals Are Talking: Why Today's Fringe Is Tomorrow's Mainstream,"The Signals Are Talking: Why Today's Fringe Is Tomorrow's Mainstream


Amy Webb is a noted futurist who combines curiosity, skepticism, colorful storytelling, and deeply reported, real-world analysis in this essential book for understanding the future. The Signals Are Talking reveals a systemic way of evaluating new ideas bubbling up on the horizon-distinguishing what is a real trend from the merely trendy. This book helps us hear which signals are talking sense, and which are simply nonsense, so that we might know today what developments-especially those seemingly random ideas at the fringe as they converge and begin to move toward the mainstream-that have long-term consequence for tomorrow.


With the methodology developed in The Signals Are Talking, we learn how to think like a futurist and answer vitally important questions: How will a technology-like artificial intelligence, machine learning, self-driving cars, biohacking, bots, and the Internet of Things-affect us personally? How will it impact our businesses and workplaces? How will it eventually change the way we live, work, play, and think-and how should we prepare for it now?


Most importantly, Webb persuasively shows that the future isn't something that happens to us passively. Instead, she allows us to see ahead so that we may forecast what's to come-challenging us to create our own preferred futures.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541788237.jpg,Amy Webb,Hachette Book Group,2018,336,Tiếng Anh,Business Strategy,https://www.fahasa.com/the-signals-are-talking-why-today-s-fringe-is-tomorrow-s-mainstream.html
"Valley Of Genius: The Uncensored History Of Silicon Valley, As Told By The Hackers, Founders, And Freaks Who Made It Boom","Valley Of Genius: The Uncensored History Of Silicon Valley, As Told By The Hackers, Founders, And Freaks Who Made It Boom


Rarely has one economy asserted itself as swiftly--and as aggressively--as the entity we now know as Silicon Valley. Built with a seemingly permanent culture of reinvention, Silicon Valley does not fight change; it embraces it, and now powers the American economy and global innovation.


So how did this omnipotent and ever-morphing place come to be? It was not by planning. It was, like many an empire before it, part luck, part timing, and part ambition. And part pure, unbridled genius...


Drawing on over two hundred in-depth interviews, VALLEY OF GENIUS takes readers from the dawn of the personal computer and the internet, through the heyday of the web, up to the very moment when our current technological reality was invented. The book interweaves stories of invention and betrayal, overnight success and underground exploits, to tell the story of Silicon Valley like it has never been told before.

Kisses For Jet: A Coming-of-Gender Story,"Kisses For Jet: A Coming-of-Gender Story


A striking and emotive graphic novel from debut trans creator, Joris Bas Backer about coming to terms with his gender before the age of the internet. For fans of Gender Queer and The Black Famingo.


“A nuanced look into the life of a trans teen by a trans author and illustrator. The black, white, and grayish-blue illustrations powerfully capture Jet’s complicated emotions.""

–BuzzFeed


""Jet’s earnest questioning and relationship with gender and adolescence illustrates the conflict between becoming who the world wants them to be and who they are, conveyed in a raw, personal-feeling portrayal of transition in a pre-internet era.""

– Publishers Weekly


""I love that this graphic novel exists for generations who may be feeling these same insecurities, anxieties, and challenges that Jet experiences.""

—Utopian State of Mind


""A warm, funny, lived-in book that captures exactly the feeling of having a desire you just can’t place, and the relief when you manage to crack it wide open.""

— Mattie Lubchansky, The Nib


""Exciting from the first to the last page! I say, this book is already a classic.""

— Ulli Lust, author of Today is the Last Day of the Rest of Your Life


“Kisses for Jet is a sensitively written, beautifully-illustrated depiction of a trans-masculine experience so rarely shown in media…a huge step forward for trans representation.”

—  Jake Hall, Author of The Art of Drag


Featured in Xtra Magazine with Interview by Gender Queer author, Maia Kobabe 


In 1999, when most people think that the world is about to end with the Y2K crash on the eve of the new Millennium, Jet is just trying to get through high school. When their Mom moves to another country to work on fixing the Millennium bug, Jet is forced to stay at a boarding house while they finish the school year, and they’re not pleased about it.


But something’s not quite right, and it’s not just the out-of-control kids that Jet has to live with, or the staff who look after the boarding house who act super suspiciously. As Jet slowly starts to feel overwhelmed by their peers, they begin to notice that they don’t feel like the other girls in their class. As new feelings start to emerge, Jet slowly begins to realise that they may be more of a boy than a girl.


Is that even possible? And who do they talk to about these feelings when there’s not even any internet around, and cell phones are barely used?


This coming-of-gender graphic novel debut from trans creator Joris Bas Backer is an enlightening and often hilarious tale that casts light on what it was like to be transgender before information and help was more accessible and widespread.

Presence,"Presence


MORE THAN HALF A MILLION COPIES SOLD: Learn the simple techniques you'll need to approach your biggest challenges with confidence.  


Have you ever left a nerve-racking challenge and immediately wished for a do over? Maybe after a job interview, a performance, or a difficult conversation? The very moments that require us to be genuine and commanding can instead cause us to feel phony and powerless. Too often we approach our lives' biggest hurdles with dread, execute them with anxiety, and leave them with regret.


By accessing our personal power, we can achieve ""presence,"" the state in which we stop worrying about the impression we're making on others and instead adjust the impression we've been making on ourselves. As Harvard professor Amy Cuddy's revolutionary book reveals, we don't need to embark on a grand spiritual quest or complete an inner transformation to harness the power of presence. Instead, we need to nudge ourselves, moment by moment, by tweaking our body language, behavior, and mind-set in our day-to-day lives.


Amy Cuddy has galvanized tens of millions of viewers around the world with her TED talk about ""power poses."" Now she presents the enthralling science underlying these and many other fascinating body-mind effects, and teaches us how to use simple techniques to liberate ourselves from fear in high-pressure moments, perform at our best, and connect with and empower others to do the same.


Brilliantly researched, impassioned, and accessible, Presence is filled with stories of individuals who learned how to flourish during the stressful moments that once terrified them. Every reader will learn how to approach their biggest challenges with confidence instead of dread, and to leave them with satisfaction instead of regret.

No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All The Trends,"No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All The Trends


Our intuition on how the world works could well be wrong. We are surprised when new competitors burst on the scene, or businesses protected by large and deep moats find their defenses easily breached, or vast new markets are conjured from nothing. Trend lines resemble saw-tooth mountain ridges.


The world not only feels different. The data tell us it is different. Based on years of research by the directors of the McKinsey Global Institute, No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Forces Breaking all the Trends is a timely and important analysis of how we need to reset our intuition as a result of four forces colliding and transforming the global economy: the rise of emerging markets, the accelerating impact of technology on the natural forces of market competition, an aging world population, and accelerating flows of trade, capital and people.


Our intuitions formed during a uniquely benign period for the world economy -- often termed the Great Moderation. Asset prices were rising, cost of capital was falling, labour and resources were abundant, and generation after generation was growing up more prosperous than their parents.


But the Great Moderation has gone. The cost of capital may rise. The price of everything from grain to steel may become more volatile. The world's labor force could shrink. Individuals, particularly those with low job skills, are at risk of growing up poorer than their parents.


What sets No Ordinary Disruption apart is depth of analysis combined with lively writing informed by surprising, memorable insights that enable us to quickly grasp the disruptive forces at work. For evidence of the shift to emerging markets, consider the startling fact that, by 2025, a single regional city in China -- Tianjin -- will have a GDP equal to that of the Sweden, of that, in the decades ahead, half of the world's economic growth will come from 440 cities including Kumasi in Ghana or Santa Carina in Brazil that most executives today would be hard-pressed to locate on a map.


What we are now seeing is no ordinary disruption but the new facts of business life -- facts that require executives and leaders at all levels to reset their operating assumptions and management intuition.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781610397353.jpg,"Richard Dobbs, James Manyika, Jonathan Woetzel",Hachette Book Group,2016,288,Tiếng Anh,Business Strategy,https://www.fahasa.com/no-ordinary-disruption-the-four-global-forces-breaking-all-the-trends.html

"Swiped: How to Protect Yourself in a World Full of Scammers, Phishers, and Identity Thieves","Swiped: How to Protect Yourself in a World Full of Scammers, Phishers, and Identity Thieves


Identity fraud happens to everyone. So what do you do when it's your turn?


Increasingly, identity theft is a fact of life. We might once have hoped to protect ourselves from hackers with airtight passwords and aggressive spam filters, and those are good ideas as far as they go. But with the breaches of huge organizations like Target, AshleyMadison.com, JPMorgan Chase, Sony, Anthem, and even the US Office of Personnel Management, more than a billion personal records have already been stolen, and chances are good that you're already in harm's way.


This doesn't mean there's no hope. Your identity may get stolen, but it doesn't have to be a life-changing event. Adam Levin, a longtime consumer advocate and identity fraud expert, provides a method to help you keep hackers, phishers, and spammers from becoming your problem.


Levin has seen every scam under the sun: fake companies selling ""credit card insurance""; criminal, medical, and child identity theft; emails that promise untold riches for some personal information; catphishers, tax fraud, fake debt collectors who threaten you with legal action to confirm your account numbers; and much more. As Levin shows, these folks get a lot less scary if you see them coming.


With a clearheaded, practical approach, Swiped is your guide to surviving the identity theft epidemic. Even if you've already become a victim, this strategic book will help you protect yourself, your identity, and your sanity.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781610397209.jpg,"Adam Levin, Beau Friedlander",Hachette Book Group,2016,288,Tiếng Anh,Personal Finance,https://www.fahasa.com/swiped-how-to-protect-yourself-in-a-world-full-of-scammers-phishers-and-identity-thieves.html

"A World Of Three Zeros: The New Economics Of Zero Poverty, Zero Unemployment, And Zero Net Carbon Emissions","A World Of Three Zeros: The New Economics Of Zero Poverty, Zero Unemployment, And Zero Net Carbon Emissions


A winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and bestselling author of Banker to the Poor offers his vision of an emerging new economic system that can save humankind and the planet


Muhammad Yunus, who created microcredit, invented social business, and earned a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in alleviating poverty, is one of today's most trenchant social critics. Now he declares it's time to admit that the capitalist engine is broken -- that in its current form it inevitably leads to rampant inequality, massive unemployment, and environmental destruction. We need a new economic system that unleashes altruism as a creative force just as powerful as self-interest.


Is this a pipe dream? Not at all. In the last decade, thousands of people and organizations have already embraced Yunus's vision of a new form of capitalism, launching innovative social businesses designed to serve human needs rather than accumulate wealth. They are bringing solar energy to millions of homes in Bangladesh; turning thousands of unemployed young people into entrepreneurs through equity investments; financing female-owned businesses in cities across the United States; bringing mobility, shelter, and other services to the rural poor in France; and creating a global support network to help young entrepreneurs launch their start-ups.


In A World of Three Zeros, Yunus describes the new civilization emerging from the economic experiments his work has helped to inspire. He explains how global companies like McCain, Renault, Essilor, and Danone got involved with this new economic model through their own social action groups, describes the ingenious new financial tools now funding social businesses, and sketches the legal and regulatory changes needed to jumpstart the next wave of socially driven innovations. And he invites young people, business and political leaders, and ordinary citizens to join the movement and help create the better world we all dream of.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781541742390.jpg,Muhammad Yunus,Hachette Book Group,2018,304,Tiếng Anh,Political Economy,https://www.fahasa.com/a-world-of-three-zeros-the-new-economics-of-zero-poverty-zero-unemployment-and-zero-net-carbon-emissions-405901.html
"Good Boss, Bad Boss: How To Be The Best... And Learn From The Worst","Good Boss, Bad Boss: How To Be The Best... And Learn From The Worst


From the New York Times bestselling author of The No Asshole Rule


'I am frequently asked, ""Tom, my brother/sister/friend is taking on a new leadership role. What should they read?"" I always respond the same way, by recommending one and only one book: Bob Sutton's Good Boss, Bad Boss' - Tom Peters, New York Times bestselling author of In Search of Excellence.


Good Boss, Bad Boss was inspired by the thousands of emails, calls and conversations that Robert Sutton received after publishing his bestseller The No Asshole Rule - he found that most of the stories and cries for help he received revolved around one central figure in every workplace: THE BOSS.


Sutton's subsequent research showed that the success of every boss depended heavily on how well (or badly) they managed those they worked with and in Good Boss, Bad Boss he demonstrates this by weaving together the best psychological and management secrets with true stories, to reveal the mindset and moves of the best bosses, and contrasts them with the behaviour of the worst.


If you want to understand how the best bosses think and act so that you can get better at your job or find a better boss to work for, Good Boss, Bad Boss has all the answers.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781538749296.jpg,Robert Sutton,Hachette Book Group,2019,352,Tiếng Anh,Business & Management,https://www.fahasa.com/good-boss-bad-boss-how-to-be-the-best-and-learn-from-the-worst-405792.html
Work Optional: Retire Early The Non-Penny-Pinching Way,"Work Optional: Retire Early The Non-Penny-Pinching Way


A practical action guide for financial independence and early retirement from the popular Our Next Life blogger.


In today's work culture, we're expected to hustle around the clock. But what if you could escape the traditional path and get on one that doesn't require working full-time until age 65? What if you could wake up every day without an alarm clock and do the things you love most?


Tanja Hester and her husband Mark left their crazed careerist lifestyle to live their dream life in Lake Tahoe, retiring early from high-stress careers. Now Tanja will help you map out a customized plan for freedom and make it easy to succeed, whether you're good at math and budgeting -- or not!

Work Optional is more than just a financial plan: it's a plan for your whole life -- designed by you, not by an employer or clients.

Fortune Makers: The Leaders Creating China's Great Global Companies,"Fortune Makers: The Leaders Creating China's Great Global Companies


Fortune Makers analyzes and brings to light the distinctive practices of business leaders who are the future of the Chinese economy. These leaders oversee not the old state-owned enterprises, but private companies that have had to invent their way forward out of the wreckage of an economy in tatters following the Cultural Revolution.


Outside of brand names such as Alibaba and Lenovo, little is known, even by the Chinese themselves, about the people present at the creation of these innovative businesses. Fortune Makers provides sharp insights into their unique styles -- a distinctive blend of the entrepreneur, the street fighter, and practices developed by the Communist Party -- and their distinctive ways of leading and managing their organizations that are unlike anything the West is familiar with.


When Peter Drucker published Concept of the Corporation in 1946, he revealed what made large American corporations tick. Similarly, when Japanese companies emerged as a global force in the 1980s, insightful analysts explained the practices that brought Japan's economy out of the ashes -- and what managers elsewhere could learn to compete with them. Now, based on unprecedented access, Fortune Makers allows business leaders in the United States and the rest of the West to understand the essential character and style of Chinese corporate life and its dominant players, whose businesses are the foundation of the domestic Chinese market and are now making their mark globally.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781610396585.jpg,"Michael Useem, Harbir Singh, Liang Neng, Peter Cappelli",Hachette Book Group,2017,288,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/fortune-makers-the-leaders-creating-china-s-great-global-companies.html

But how, he used to wonder, could he best describe the interactions of millions of users, a complicated system of human connections? One day, while hiking through Joshua Tree National Park, Luckett had a flashback to his days as a microbiology lab rat -- and an epiphany: social media is an organism, a living, breathing, evolving creature. Luckett and Casey deliver a revolutionary theory of social networks, showing -- to an astonishing degree -- how they mimic biological life.

The Revenge Of Analog: Real Things And Why They Matter,"The Revenge Of Analog: Real Things And Why They Matter


One of Michiko Kakutani's (New York Times) top ten books of 2016


A funny thing happened on the way to the digital utopia. We've begun to fall back in love with the very analog goods and ideas the tech gurus insisted that we no longer needed. Businesses that once looked outdated, from film photography to brick-and-mortar retail, are now springing with new life. Notebooks, records, and stationery have become cool again. Behold the Revenge of Analog.


David Sax has uncovered story after story of entrepreneurs, small business owners, and even big corporations who've found a market selling not apps or virtual solutions but real, tangible things. As e-books are supposedly remaking reading, independent bookstores have sprouted up across the country. As music allegedly migrates to the cloud, vinyl record sales have grown more than ten times over the past decade. Even the offices of tech giants like Google and Facebook increasingly rely on pen and paper to drive their brightest ideas.


Sax's work reveals a deep truth about how humans shop, interact, and even think. Blending psychology and observant wit with first-rate reportage, Sax shows the limited appeal of the purely digital life-and the robust future of the real world outside it.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781610398213.jpg,David Sax,Hachette Book Group,2017,304,Tiếng Anh,Industrial Chemistry & Manufacturing Technologies,https://www.fahasa.com/the-revenge-of-analog-real-things-and-why-they-matter.html

Rise Of The Robots: Technology And The Threat Of A Jobless Future,"Rise Of The Robots: Technology And The Threat Of A Jobless Future


The New York Times-bestselling guide to how automation is changing the economy, undermining work, and reshaping our lives


Winner of Best Business Book of the Year awards from the Financial Times and from Forbes


""Lucid, comprehensive, and unafraid . . . ;an indispensable contribution to a long-running argument."" -- Los Angeles Times


What are the jobs of the future? How many will there be? And who will have them? As technology continues to accelerate and machines begin taking care of themselves, fewer people will be necessary. Artificial intelligence is already well on its way to making ""good jobs"" obsolete: many paralegals, journalists, office workers, and even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by robots and smart software. As progress continues, blue and white collar jobs alike will evaporate, squeezing working -- and middle-class families ever further. At the same time, households are under assault from exploding costs, especially from the two major industries-education and health care-that, so far, have not been transformed by information technology. The result could well be massive unemployment and inequality as well as the implosion of the consumer economy itself.


The past solutions to technological disruption, especially more training and education, aren't going to work. We must decide, now, whether the future will see broad-based prosperity or catastrophic levels of inequality and economic insecurity. Rise of the Robots is essential reading to understand what accelerating technology means for our economic prospects-not to mention those of our children-as well as for society as a whole.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780465097531.jpg,Martin Ford,Hachette Book Group,2016,368,Tiếng Anh,Electronics Engineering,https://www.fahasa.com/rise-of-the-robots-technology-and-the-threat-of-a-jobless-future.html

But this summer is different, and as teenage Margot drifts apart from her sisters, slamming doors and keeping secrets, Kyra starts to worry. When Margot is enticed into the woods by the mysterious figures in the mist, Kyra resolves to do everything in her power to save her sister from danger, even if that means facing the spooky forces within Frygea Forest with just her kid sister for help.

""France, for me, was not a simple country to visit. It was a place that always emotionally touched me whenever I returned, for I was able to speak the language I had learned during my childhood years, and to hug the dear French people who saw me as a family member. I had a love for France which I could not describe. I only knew that there was an invisible cord connecting my heart to that beautiful land. And, of course, the French people I've known for decades have a deep-down dear love for me, far beyond a normal friendship."" - Duong Thuy",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/8/9/8934974180616.jpg,Dương Thụy,NXB Trẻ,2022,200,Tiếng Anh,Tiểu thuyết,https://www.fahasa.com/the-little-doll-and-the-big-giant-bup-be-nho-xiu-va-chang-khong-lo.html

ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2022 IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, GUARDIAN, INDEPENDENT, GLAMOUR, STYLIST, INEWS, SUNDAY TIMES STYLE, LITERARY FRICTION PODCAST AND MORE.


A fiercely poetic coming-of-age novel following a group of young women of colour in Queens, New York.


‘Brown Girls flows like a late night FM-radio dedication to the crew, the block, and the mission. This book’s a gift’ Paul Beatty, author of The Sellout

‘An ode to girlhood’ Raven Leilani, author of Luster

If you really want to know, we are the colour of 7-Eleven root beer. Colour of the charcoal pencil our sisters use to rim their eyes. Colour of peanut butter.


Brown Girls dives deep into the lives of a group of young women of colour growing up in Queens, New York. Here, streets echo with many languages, subways rumble above dollar stores and the briny scent of the ocean wafts in from Rockaway Beach. Here, girls like Nadira, Gabby, Naz, Trish, Angelique, and many others, struggle to reconcile their immigrant backgrounds with the American culture they come of age in. Here, they become friends for life. Or so they vow.


In this bold debut told in a uniquely lyrical voice, Daphne Palasi Andreades paints a stunning collective portrait of the journey from girlhood to adulthood, set against a backdrop of race, class, and marginalisation in America today. Brown Girls is an unforgettable love letter to women of colour everywhere from a daring new writer.

The feminist book they tried to ban in France

‘A delightful book’ Roxane Gay

Women, especially feminists and lesbians, have long been accused of hating men. Our instinct is to deny it at all costs. (After all, women have been burnt at the stake for admitting to less.)


But what if mistrusting men, disliking men – and yes, maybe even hating men – is, in fact, a useful response to sexism? What if such a response offers a way out of oppression, a means of resistance? What if it even offers a path to joy, solidarity and sisterhood?


In this sparkling essay, as mischievous and provocative as it is urgent and serious, Pauline Harmange interrogates modern attitudes to feminism and makes a rallying cry for women to find a greater love for each other – and themselves.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008457594.jpg,"Pauline Harmange, Natasha Lehrer",Usborne,2022,112,Tiếng Anh,Society & Culture: General,https://www.fahasa.com/i-hate-men.html

'The most important work of contemporary reporting I have ever read' SALLY ROONEY


The Western world has turned its back on refugees, fuelling one of the most devastating human rights disasters in history.


In August 2018, Sally Hayden received a Facebook message. 'Hi sister Sally, we need your help,' it read. 'We are under bad condition in Libya prison. If you have time, I will tell you all the story.' More messages followed from more refugees. They told stories of enslavement and trafficking, torture and murder, tuberculosis and sexual abuse. And they revealed something else: that they were all incarcerated as a direct result of European policy.


From there began a staggering investigation into the migrant crisis across North Africa. This book follows the shocking experiences of refugees seeking sanctuary, but it also surveys the bigger picture: the negligence of NGOs and corruption within the United Nations. The economics of the twenty-first-century slave trade and the EU's bankrolling of Libyan militias. The trials of people smugglers, the frustrations of aid workers, the loopholes refugees seek out and the role of social media in crowdfunding ransoms. Who was accountable for the abuse? Where were the people finding solutions? Why wasn't it being widely reported?


At its heart, this is a book about people who have made unimaginable choices, risking everything to survive in a system that wants them to be silent and disappear.

The ice dragon had always been in her life, glimpsed from afar as she played in the snow long after the other children had fled the cold. In her fourth year she touched it, and in her fifth year she rode upon its broad, chilled back.


Then, in her seventh year, on a calm summer day, fiery dragons from the North swooped down upon the peaceful farm that was Adara’s home.

Nazi Billionaires: The Dark History Of Germany’s Wealthiest Dynasties,"Nazi Billionaires: The Dark History Of Germany’s Wealthiest Dynasties


‘Lucid and damning … an absorbing – and infuriating – tale of complicity, coverup and denial’ PATRICK RADDEN KEEFE, author of EMPIRE OF PAIN

A groundbreaking investigation of how the Nazis helped German tycoons make billions from the horrors of the Third Reich and World War II – and how the world allowed them to get away with it.


In 1946, Günther Quandt – patriarch of Germany’s most iconic industrial empire, a dynasty that today controls BMW – was arrested for suspected Nazi collaboration. Quandt claimed that he had been forced to join the party by his arch-rival, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, and the courts acquitted him. But Quandt lied. And his heirs, and those of other Nazi billionaires, have only grown wealthier in the generations since, while their reckoning with this dark past remains incomplete at best. Many of them continue to control swaths of the world economy, owning iconic brands whose products blanket the globe. The brutal legacy of the dynasties that dominated Daimler-Benz, cofounded Allianz and still control Porsche, Volkswagen and BMW has remained hidden in plain sight – until now.


In this landmark work, investigative journalist David de Jong reveals the true story of how Germany’s wealthiest business dynasties amassed untold money and power by abetting the atrocities of the Third Reich. Using a wealth of untapped sources, de Jong shows how these tycoons seized Jewish businesses, procured slave labourers and ramped up weapons production to equip Hitler’s army as Europe burnt around them. Most shocking of all, de Jong exposes how the wider world’s political expediency enabled these billionaires to get away with their crimes, covering up a bloodstain that defiles the German and global economy to this day.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008299774.jpg,David de Jong,Usborne,2022,400,Tiếng Anh,Economic History,https://www.fahasa.com/nazi-billionaires-the-dark-history-of-germany-s-wealthiest-dynasties.html

‘Thrilling … High-definition history: tight, thrilling and beautifully researched’ SUNDAY TIMES


‘This book is a triumph’ DAN SNOW


9.07 a.m., April 12, 1961. A top-secret rocket site in the USSR. A young Russian sits inside a tiny capsule on top of the Soviet Union’s most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile – originally designed to carry a nuclear warhead – and blasts into the skies. His name is Yuri Gagarin and he is about to make history.


Travelling at almost 18,000 miles per hour – ten times faster than a rifle bullet – Gagarin circles the globe in just 106 minutes. While his launch begins in total secrecy, within hours of his landing he has become a world celebrity – the first human to leave the planet.


Beyond tells the thrilling story behind that epic flight on its sixtieth anniversary. It happened at the height of the Cold War as the US and USSR confronted each other across an Iron Curtain. Both superpowers took enormous risks to get a man into space first – the Americans in the full glare of the media, the Soviets under deep cover. Both trained their teams of astronauts to the edges of the endurable. In the end the race between them would come down to the wire.


Drawing on extensive original research and the vivid testimonies of eyewitnesses, many of whom have never spoken before, Stephen Walker unpacks secrets that were hidden for decades and takes the reader into the drama – featuring the scientists, engineers and political leaders on both sides, and above all the American astronauts and their Soviet rivals battling for supremacy in the heavens.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008372545.jpg,Stephen Walker,Usborne,2022,512,Tiếng Anh,"Biography: Science, Technology & Engineering",https://www.fahasa.com/beyond-the-astonishing-story-of-the-first-human-to-leave-our-planet-and-journey-into-space.html

‘a masterpiece.’

STEPHEN FRY


Jews Don’t Count is a book for people on the right side of history. People fighting the good fight against homophobia, disablism, transphobia and, particularly, racism. People, possibly, like you.

It is the comedian and writer David Baddiel’s contention that one type of racism has been left out of this fight. In his unique combination of reasoning, polemic, personal experience and jokes, Baddiel argues that those who think of themselves as on the right side of history have often ignored the history of anti-Semitism. He outlines why and how, in a time of intensely heightened awareness of minorities, Jews don’t count as a real minority.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008399511.jpg,David Baddiel,Usborne,2022,160,Tiếng Anh,Laws Of Specific Jurisdictions,https://www.fahasa.com/jews-don-t-count.html

Moonshot: Inside Pfizer's Nine-month Race To Make The Impossible Possible,"Moonshot: Inside Pfizer's Nine-month Race To Make The Impossible Possible


The exclusive, first-hand, behind-the-scenes story of how Pfizer raced to create the first Covid-19 vaccine, told by Pfizer's CEO Dr. Albert Bourla


A riveting, fast-paced, inside look at one of the most incredible private sector achievements in history, Moonshot recounts the intensive nine months in 2020 when the scientists at Pfizer, under the visionary leadership of Dr. Albert Bourla, made ""the impossible possible""-creating, testing, and manufacturing a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine that previously would have taken years to develop.


Dr. Bourla chronicles how the brilliant, dedicated minds at Pfizer, under the enormous strains of the global pandemic, overcame a series of crises that were compounded by social and political unrest, and reveals the doubts, decisions, obstacles, and failures they encountered. As Dr. Bourla makes clear, Pfizer's success wasn't due to luck; it was because of preparation driven by four simple values-Courage, Excellence, Equity, and Joy.


Moonshot is a story of leadership under the most unprecedented circumstances-how Dr. Bourla, a Greek immigrant, a child of Holocaust survivors, and a veterinarian, became the head of one of the world's largest corporations and initiated a dramatic transformation of the organization just before a global health crisis would serve to test the organization, its scientists and its leader, like never before. Moonshot describes best practices that can be used to address the multiple, unprecedented challenges our world faces, reveals Pfizer's implementation of scientific breakthroughs at a record-breaking pace, and offers leadership lessons that can help anyone successfully manage their own seemingly unsolvable problems. As Dr. Bourla explains, ""I am sharing the story of our moonshot-the challenges we faced, the lessons we learned, and the core values that allowed us to make it happen-in hopes that it might inspire and inform your own moonshot, whatever that may be.""",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008503994.jpg,Albert Bourla,Usborne,2022,288,Tiếng Anh,Public Health & Preventive Medicine,https://www.fahasa.com/moonshot-inside-pfizer-s-nine-month-race-to-make-the-impossible-possible.html
Girl In The Walls,"Girl In The Walls


She doesn’t exist. She can’t exist.


‘A uniquely gothic tale about grief, belonging and hiding in plain sight’ Jess Kidd, author of Things in Jars


’Those who live in the walls must adjust, must twist themselves around in their home, stretching themselves until they’re as thin as air. Not everyone can do what they can.

But soon enough, they can’t help themselves. Signs of their presence remain in a house.

Eventually, every hidden thing is found.’


Elise knows every inch of the house. She knows which boards will creak. She knows where the gaps are in the walls. She knows which parts can take her in, hide her away. It’s home, after all. The home her parents made for her. And home is where you stay, no matter what.

‘Epic… It just consumed me' Oprah Winfrey, Oprah Book Club


‘The kind of book that comes around only once a decade' Washington Post


A breath-taking debut novel that chronicles the journey of generations of one American family, from the centuries of the colonial slave trade to our own tumultuous era


The great scholar, W.E.B. Du Bois, once wrote about the Problem of race in America, and what he called ‘Double Consciousness,’ a sensitivity that every African American possesses in order to survive. Since childhood, Ailey Pearl Garfield has understood Du Bois's words all too well.


From an early age, Ailey fights a battle to feel like she belongs, made all the more difficult by a hovering trauma, as well as the whispers of women – her mother, her sister and a maternal line reaching back two centuries – that urge her to succeed in their stead.


Ailey decides to embark on a journey through her family's past, uncovering the shocking tales of generations of ancestors – Indigenous, Black, and white – in the deep South. In doing so she must learn to embrace her full heritage, a legacy of oppression and resistance, bondage and independence, cruelty and resilience that is the story – and the song – of America itself.


Sweeping, compulsive and deeply moving, The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois by Honorée Fanonne Jeffers is set to be one of the most talked about books of the year.

Do Not Disturb: The Story Of A Political Murder And An African Regime Gone Bad,"Do Not Disturb: The Story Of A Political Murder And An African Regime Gone Bad


AN ECONOMIST BOOK OF THE YEAR 2021


A new book from the award winning author of In the Footsteps of Mr Kurtz,Do Not Disturb explores the controversial career of Paul Kagame and the legacy of the Rwandan genocide


‘A withering assault on the murderous regime of Kagame, and a melancholy love song to the last dreams of the African Great Lakes’ John Le Carre


Do Not Disturb is a dramatic recasting of the modern history of Africa’s Great Lakes region, an area blighted by the greatest genocide of the twentieth century. This bold retelling, vividly sourced by direct testimony from key participants, tears up the traditional script.


In the old version, an idealistic group of young rebels overthrows a genocidal regime in Kigali, ushering in an era of peace and stability that makes Rwanda the donor darling of the West, winning comparisons with Switzerland and Singapore. The new version examines afresh questions which dog the recent past: Why do so many ex-rebels scoff at official explanations of who fired the missile that killed the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi? Why didn’t the mass killings end when the rebels took control? Why did those same rebels, victory secured, turn so ruthlessly on one another?


Michela Wrong uses the story of Patrick Karegeya, once Rwanda’s head of external intelligence and a quicksilver operator of supple charm, to paint the portrait of a modern African dictatorship created in the chilling likeness of Paul Kagame, the president who sanctioned his former friend’s murder.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008238902.jpg,Michela Wrong,Usborne,2022,512,Tiếng Anh,Politics & Government,https://www.fahasa.com/do-not-disturb-the-story-of-a-political-murder-and-an-african-regime-gone-bad.html

Jane has set in motion a series of events that quickly spin beyond her control. She is being followed, her home surveilled, her family in peril. The author of the mysterious note―Jane’s only real lead―is already dead. She was, Jane learns, a reputed ecoterrorist. What did she want with Jane?


Profiteering wildlife smugglers; an amoral energy company; an extremist’s apocalyptic vision. The threats come from all around, and time is running out―for Jane and possibly for the world.

The Caretakers,"The Caretakers


“Bestor-Siegal switches perspective among a group of characters with tenderness and intimacy. . . . The writing is smooth as honey. . . It's utterly absorbing.” — NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW


“Thrilling and deeply moving, gorgeously written and intricately plotted . . . bold and brilliant."" –ELIZABETH MCCRACKEN 


Recommended by New York Times Book Review •USA Today• Glamour • Business Insider • Popsugar • CrimeReads • The Millions • BookRiot • and more!


Set in a wealthy Parisian suburb, an emotionally riveting debut told from the point of view of six women, and centered around a group of au pairs, one of whom is arrested after a sudden and suspicious tragedy strikes her host family—a dramatic exploration of identity, class, and caregiving from a profoundly talented new writer.


Paris, 2015. A crowd gathers outside the Chauvet home in the affluent suburban community of Maisons-Larue, watching as the family’s American au pair is led away in handcuffs after the sudden death of her young charge. The grieving mother believes the caretaker is to blame, and the neighborhood is thrown into chaos, unsure who is at fault—the enigmatic, young foreigner or the mother herself, who has never seemed an active participant in the lives of her children.  


The truth lies with six women: Géraldine, a heartbroken French teacher struggling to support her vulnerable young students; Lou, an incompetent au pair who was recently fired by the family next door; Charlotte, a chilly socialite and reluctant mother; Nathalie, an isolated French teenager desperate for her mother’s attention; Holly, a socially anxious au pair yearning to belong in her adopted country; and finally, Alena, the one accused of the crime, who has gone to great lengths to avoid emotional connection, and now finds herself caught in the turbulent power dynamics of her host family’s household.


Set during the weeks leading up to the event, The Caretakers is a poignant and suspenseful drama featuring complicated women. It’s a sensitive exploration of the weight of secrets, the pressures of country, community, and family—and miscommunications and misunderstandings that can have fatal consequences.


“A deep, enthralling pleasure, as wise as it is lovely. I read it voraciously, desperate to discover the fates of its unforgettable characters . . .

‘Clear-eyed, frank, wise and joyous!’ Andrew Sean Greer


‘If you read only one book this year, then this must be it’ Sarah Winman


There is so much to be afraid of in our current moment: climate catastrophe, the rise of a new fascism, a virus that has reshaped the way we live. But something better is possible.

A wry, provocative and very funny debut novel about identity, authenticity and the self in the age of the internet


'I loved it' Zadie Smith


'Brilliant, very funny' Guardian


'Prepare to feel very seen' I-D


On the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration, a young woman snoops through her boyfriend's phone and makes a startling discovery: he's an anonymous Internet conspiracy theorist, and a popular one at that. Already fluent in Internet fakery, irony, and outrage, she's not exactly shocked by the revelation. But this is only the first in a series of bizarre twists that expose a world whose truths are shaped by online lies.


Suddenly left with no reason to stay in New York - or be anywhere in particular - she flees to Berlin, and embarks on her own cycles of manipulation in the deceptive spaces of her daily life, from dating apps to expat social events, open-plan offices to bureaucratic waiting rooms.


Narrated in a voice as seductive as it is subtly subversive, Fake Accounts is a wry, provocative and very funny debut novel about identity and authenticity in the age of the internet.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008366568.jpg,Oyler Lauren,Usborne,2022,348,Tiếng Anh,"Dating, Relationships, Living Together & Marriage",https://www.fahasa.com/fake-accounts.html

Plays Well With Others: The Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know About Relationships Is (Mostly) Wrong,"Plays Well With Others: The Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know About Relationships Is (Mostly) Wrong


AN INSTANT USA TODAY and PUBLISHERS WEEKLY BESTSELLER


From the author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller Barking Up the Wrong Tree comes a cure-all for our increasing emotional distance and loneliness—a smart, surprising, and thoroughly entertaining guide to help build better friendships, reignite love, and get closer to others, whether you’re an extrovert or introvert, socially adept or socially anxious.


Can you judge a book by its cover? 


Is a friend in need truly a friend indeed? 


Does love conquer all? 


Is no man an island? 


In Plays Well with Others, Eric Barker dives into these age-old maxims drawing on science to reveal the truth beyond the conventional wisdom about human relationships. Combining his compelling storytelling and humor, Barker explains what hostage negotiation techniques and marital arguments have in common, how an expert con-man lied his way into a twenty-year professional soccer career, and why those holding views diametrically opposed to our own actually have the potential to become our closest, most trusted friends.


Inside you will learn:


The two things essential to making friends – and what Dale Carnegie got wrong.

What creates love, reignites love, and sustains love. (There’s no Build-A-Bear store for a happy marriage but this is close.)

The ethical and effective way to get your partner to change.

How social media can actually improve relationships.

The antidote to loneliness and why what we usually hear doesn’t work.

And so much more. The book is packed with high-five-worthy stories about the greatest female detective to ever live, the most successful liar to ever open his mouth, genius horses, thieving hermits, the perils of perfect memories, and placebos. Leveraging the best evidence available—free of platitudes or magical thinking—Barker analyzes multiple sides of an issue before rendering his verdict. What he’s uncovered is surprising, counterintuitive, and timely—and will change the way you interact in the world and with those around you just when you need it most.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063267039.jpg,Eric Barker,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,304,Tiếng Anh,Advice On Careers & Achieving Success,https://www.fahasa.com/plays-well-with-others-the-surprising-science-behind-why-everything-you-know-about-relationships-is-mostly-wrong.html
On Quality: An Inquiry Into Excellence: Unpublished And Selected Writings,"On Quality: An Inquiry Into Excellence: Unpublished And Selected Writings


Featuring long-awaited selections from Robert M. Pirsig's unpublished writings, from before and after Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, an original collection illuminating the central theme of Pirsig's thought: “Quality”


“The ultimate goal in the pursuit of excellence is enlightenment."" —Robert M. Pirsig, 1962


More than a decade before the release of the book that would make him famous, Robert M. Pirsig had already caught hold of the central theme that would animate Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: “Quality,” a concept loosely likened to “excellence,” “rightness,” or “fitness” that Pirsig saw as kindred to the Buddhist ideas of “dharma” or the “Tao.” As he later wrote in Zen, “Quality is the Buddha.”


Though he was revered by fans who considered him a guru, the famously private Pirsig published only two books and consented to few interviews and almost no public appearances in later decades. Yet he wrote and thought almost continually, refining his “Metaphysics of Quality” until his death in 2017.


Now, for the first time, readers will be granted access to five decades of Pirsig’s personal writings in this posthumous collection that illuminates the evolution of his thinking to an unprecedented degree. Skillfully edited and introduced by Wendy K. Pirsig, Robert’s wife of four decades, the collection includes previously unpublished texts, speeches, letters, interviews, and private notes, as well as key excerpts from Zen and the Art of the Motorcycle Maintenance and his second book, Lila.


Since its publication in 1974, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has established itself as a modern classic of popular philosophy; selling millions of copies and inspiring a generation, while serving as a perennial touchstone for the generations that follow. On Quality is a remarkable contribution to our understanding of one of the most influential thinkers and writers of our time.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063084643.jpg,"Robert M Pirsig, Wendy K.

The Anxious Investor: Mastering The Mental Game Of Investing,"The Anxious Investor: Mastering The Mental Game Of Investing


A revelatory new guide to becoming a smarter investor, drawing upon behavioral psychology, economic modeling, and market history to offer practical advice for reaching your financial goals


""With the equity and fixed-income markets off to a rough start in 2022, investors might do well to review the lessons shared in Mr. Nations’s book."" —Wall Street Journal


The human brain is ill-suited to making wise investment decisions. We are overconfident in our own knowledge and hunches, terrible at assessing risk, and prone to chasing financial thrills rather than measured long-term goals. Making matters worse, periods of severe market turbulence—whether the dotcom bubble of the late 90’s, the Great Recession a decade later, or the brief, vertiginous COVID crash of 2020—bring out our most irrational selves, at the exact moment when the consequences for investment mistakes are most severe.


Scott Nations has spent his career studying market volatility. His firm, Nations Indexes, is the world’s leading independent developer of volatility and option-enhanced indexes. In The Anxious Investor, he teaches readers how to understand markets, master their own fear, and make the most of their money. Drawing upon cutting-edge research in behavioral psychology, Nations shows that the secrets to excellent investing lie in mastering the quirks of human psychology. How are some investors able to make prudent decisions under pressure, while others rely on gut instinct to disastrous effect? How can we prepare for a market crash before it happens? And what can help us stay the course when the waters get choppy? Using the stories of three infamous market bubbles as his backdrop, Nations offers readers history’s hard-earned lessons about greed, volatility, and value.


Whether you’re saving for retirement, a home, or a child’s college education, The Anxious Investor offers a blueprint for achieving your goals. While we can never know exactly which financial surprises may loom ahead, here is an indispensable resource for investors to make sense of them.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063067608.jpg,Scott Nations,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,288,Tiếng Anh,Personal Finance,https://www.fahasa.com/the-anxious-investor-mastering-the-mental-game-of-investing.html

HYACINTH’S STORY


Meet Our Hero . . .


Gareth St. Clair is in a bind. His father, who detests him, is determined to beggar the St. Clair estates and ruin his inheritance. Gareth’s sole bequest is an old family diary, which may or may not contain the secrets of his past . . . and the key to his future. The problem is—it’s written in Italian, of which Gareth speaks not a word.


Meet Our Heroine . . .


All the ton agreed: there was no one quite like Hyacinth Bridgerton. She’s fiendishly smart, devilishly outspoken, and according to Gareth, probably best in small doses. But there’s something about her—something charming and vexing—that grabs him and won’t quite let go . . .


Meet Poor Mr. Mozart . . .


Or don’t. But rest assured, he’s spinning in his grave when Gareth and Hyacinth cross paths at the annual—and annually discordant—Smythe-Smith musicale.

The highly anticipated second novel from Sarai Walker, following her “slyly subversive” (EW) cult-hit Dietland—a feminist gothic about the lone survivor of a cursed family of sisters, whose time may finally be up.?


IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.


INSTEAD IT WAS THE LAST.


Iris Chapel and her five elegant sisters, all of them heiresses to the Chapel firearms fortune, live cloistered in a lavish Victorian mansion. Neglected by both a distant, workaholic father and a mentally troubled mother—who believes their home is haunted by the victims of Chapel weapons—the sisters have grown up with only each other for company. They long to escape the eerie fairy tale of their childhood and move forward into the modern world, but for young women in 1950s Connecticut, the only way out is through marriage.


Yet it soon becomes clear that for the Chapel sisters, marriage equals death. 


When the eldest sister walks down the aisle, tragedy strikes. The bride dies mysteriously the very next day, leaving her family and the town in shock. But this is just the beginning of a chain of disasters that will make each woman wonder whether true love will kill her, too. Only Iris, the second-youngest, finds a way to escape—but can she outrun the family curse forever?

Viral: The Search For The Origin Of COVID-19,"Viral: The Search For The Origin Of COVID-19


""Chan and Ridley write with an urgency...that inspires gripping depictions of what viruses are, how infectious-disease laboratories work and wonderfully lucid descriptions of bats. . . . They powerfully recount how dangerous pathogens can both leak from a lab and emerge in nature."" (New York Times Book Review) 


Understanding how Covid-19 started is crucial for the future of humankind. Viral is the most incisive and authoritative book about the search for the source of the virus.


A new virus descended on the human species in 2019 wreaking unprecedented havoc. Finding out where it came from and how it first jumped into people is an urgent priority, but early expectations that this would prove an easy question to answer have been dashed. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the crucial mystery of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not only unresolved but has deepened.


 In this uniquely insightful book, a scientist and a writer join forces to try to get to the bottom of how a virus whose closest relations live in bats in subtropical southern China somehow managed to begin spreading among people more than 1,500 kilometres away in the city of Wuhan. They grapple with the baffling fact that the virus left none of the expected traces that such outbreaks usually create: no infected market animals or wildlife, no chains of early cases in travellers to the city, no smouldering epidemic in a rural area, no rapid adaptation of the virus to its new host—human beings.


 To try to solve this pressing mystery, Viral delves deep into the events of 2019 leading up to 2021, the details of what went on in animal markets and virology laboratories, the records and data hidden from sight within archived Chinese theses and websites, and the clues that can be coaxed from the very text of the virus’s own genetic code.


 The result is a gripping detective story that takes the reader deeper and deeper into a metaphorical cave of mystery. One by one the authors explore promising tunnels only to show that they are blind alleys, until, miles beneath the surface, they find themselves tantalisingly close to a shaft that leads to the light.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063139121.jpg,"Matt Ridley, Alina Chan",HarperCollins Publishers,2021,416,Tiếng Anh,Microbiology (non-medical),https://www.fahasa.com/viral-the-search-for-the-origin-of-covid-19.html

""So fresh and unsettling that it will enchant you from the first page and linger for days after reading...Its epic family saga style echoes that of Hala Alyan’s Salt Houses and The Arsonists’ City, Ayad Akhtar’s Homeland Elegies, and Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko."" -- Los Angeles Review of Books


In 2013, Sara is a philosophy professor at Kuwait University, having returned to Kuwait from Berkeley in the wake of her mother’s sudden death eleven years earlier. Her main companions are her grandmother’s talking parrot, Bebe Mitu; the family cook, Aasif; and Maria, her childhood ayah and the one person who has always been there for her. Sara’s relationship with Kuwait is complicated; it is a country she always thought she would leave, and a country she recognizes less and less, and yet a certain inertia keeps her there. But when teaching Nietzsche in her Intro to Philosophy course leads to an accusation of blasphemy, which carries with it the threat of execution, Sara realizes she must reconcile her feelings and her place in the world once and for all.


Interspersed with Sara’s narrative are the stories of her grandmothers: beautiful and stubborn Yasmine, who marries the son of the Pasha of Basra and lives to regret it, and Lulwa, born poor in the old town of Kuwait, swept off her feet to an estate in India by the son of a successful merchant family; and her two mothers: Noura, who dreams of building a life in America and helping to shape its Mid-East policies, and Maria, who leaves her own children behind in Pune to raise Sara and her brother Karim and, in so doing, transforms many lives.


Ranging from the 1920s to the near present, An Unlasting Home traces Kuwait’s rise from a pearl-diving backwater to its reign as a thriving cosmopolitan city to the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion. At once intimate and sweeping, personal and political, it is an unforgettable epic and a spellbinding family saga.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063135093.jpg,Mai Al-Nakib,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,400,Tiếng Anh,Historical Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/an-unlasting-home.html

Take Your Breath Away,"Take Your Breath Away


A missing woman. A husband suspected. The truth will . . .


TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY


From the New York Times bestselling author of Find You First and Elevator Pitch comes a gripping psychological thriller about a formerly missing woman who has suddenly returned under mysterious circumstances.


One weekend, while Andrew Mason was on a fishing trip, his wife, Brie, vanished without a trace. Most everyone assumed Andy had got away with murder—it’s always the husband, isn’t it?—but the police could never build a strong case against him. For a while, Andy hit rock bottom—he drank too much to numb the pain, was abandoned by all his friends save one, nearly lost his business, and became a pariah in the place he once called home.


Now, six years later, Andy has finally put his life back together. He sold the house he once shared with Brie and moved away. To tell the truth, he wasn’t sad to hear that the old place was razed and a new house built on the site. He’s settled down with a new partner, Jayne, and life is good.


But Andy’s peaceful world is about to shatter. One day, a woman shows up at his old address, screaming, “Where’s my house? What’s happened to my house?” And then, just as suddenly as she appeared, the woman—who bears a striking resemblance to Brie—is gone. The police are notified and old questions—and dark suspicions—resurface. 


Could Brie really be alive after all these years? If so, where has she been? It soon becomes clear that Andy’s future and the lives of those closest to him depend on discovering what the hell is going on. The trick will be whether he can stay alive long enough to unearth the answers.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063243170.jpg,Linwood Barclay,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,464,Tiếng Anh,Thrillers,https://www.fahasa.com/take-your-breath-away.html

After Steve: How Apple Became A Trillion-dollar Company And Lost Its Soul,"After Steve: How Apple Became A Trillion-dollar Company And Lost Its Soul


From the New York Times' Tripp Mickle, the dramatic, untold story inside Apple after the passing of Steve Jobs by following his top lieutenants—Jony Ive, the Chief Design Officer, and Tim Cook, the COO-turned-CEO—and how the fading of the former and the rise of the latter led to Apple losing its soul.


Steve Jobs called Jony Ive his “spiritual partner at Apple.” The London-born genius was the second-most powerful person at Apple and the creative force who most embodies Jobs’s spirit, the man who designed the products adopted by hundreds of millions the world over: the iPod, iPad, MacBook Air, the iMac G3, and the iPhone. In the wake of his close collaborator’s death, the chief designer wrestled with grief and initially threw himself into his work designing the new Apple headquarters and the Watch before losing his motivation in a company increasingly devoted more to margins than to inspiration.


In many ways, Cook was Ive’s opposite. The product of a small Alabama town, he had risen through the ranks from the supply side of the company. His gift was not the creation of new products. Instead, he had invented countless ways to maximize a margin, squeezing some suppliers, persuading others to build factories the size of cities to churn out more units. He considered inventory evil. He knew how to make subordinates sweat with withering questions.


Jobs selected Cook as his successor, and Cook oversaw a period of tremendous revenue growth that has lifted Apple’s valuation to $2 trillion. He built a commanding business in China and rapidly distinguished himself as a master politician who could forge global alliances and send the world’s stock market into freefall with a single sentence.


Author Tripp Mickle spoke with more than 200 current and former Apple executives, as well as figures key to this period of Apple’s history, including Trump administration officials and fashion luminaries such as Anna Wintour while writing After Steve. His research shows the company’s success came at a cost. Apple lost its innovative spirit and has not designed a new category of device in years. Ive’s departure in 2019 marked a culmination in Apple’s shift from a company of innovation to one of operational excellence, and the price is a company that has lost its soul.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063009813.jpg,Tripp Mickle,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,512,Tiếng Anh,"Biography: Science, Technology & Engineering",https://www.fahasa.com/after-steve-how-apple-became-a-trillion-dollar-company-and-lost-its-soul.html

For fans of The Burning Girl by Claire Messud and Burnt Sugar by Avni Doshi, a stunning, gut-punch of a novel that follows a young Indian American woman who, in the wake of tragedy, must navigate her family's expectations as she grapples with a complicated love and loss.


On the cusp of her eighteenth birthday, Heera and her best friends, siblings Marie and Marco, tease the fun out of life in Raleigh, North Carolina, with acts of rebellion and delinquency. They paint the town’s water towers with red anarchy symbols and hang out at the local bus station to pickpocket money for their Great Escape to New York.

In its wake, Marco reinvents himself as Crash and spends his days womanizing and burning through a string of jobs. Meanwhile, Heera’s dream to go to college in New York is suddenly upended.

"Hello, Molly!: A Memoir","Hello, Molly!: A Memoir


A New York Times bestseller


A candid, compulsively readable, hilarious, and heartbreaking memoir of resilience and redemption by comedic genius Molly Shannon


At age four, Molly Shannon’s world was shattered when she lost her mother, baby sister, and cousin in a car accident with her father at the wheel. Held together by her tender and complicated relationship with her grieving father, Molly was raised in a permissive household where her gift for improvising and role-playing blossomed alongside the fearlessness that would lead her to become a celebrated actress.


From there, Molly ventured into the wider world of New York and Los Angeles show business, where she created her own opportunities and developed her daring and empathetic comedy. Filled with behind-the-scenes stories involving everyone from Whitney Houston to Adam Sandler to Monica Lewinsky, many told for the first time here, Hello, Molly! spans Molly’s time on Saturday Night Live—where she starred alongside Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, Cheri Oteri, Tracy Morgan, and Jimmy Fallon, among many others. At the same time, it explores with humor and candor her struggle to come to terms with the legacy of her father, a man who both fostered her gifts and drive and was left with the impossible task of raising his kids alone after the loss of her mother.


Witty, winning, and told with tremendous energy and heart, Hello, Molly!, written with Sean Wilsey, sheds new and revelatory light on the life and work of one of our most talented and free-spirited performers.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063056237.jpg,"Molly Shannon, Sean Wilsey",HarperCollins Publishers,2022,304,Tiếng Anh,Memoirs,https://www.fahasa.com/hello-molly-a-memoir.html

NOW AN APPLE TV+ SERIES


A Washington Post Notable Work of Fiction * Winner of the British Book Awards Fiction Book of the Year and overall Book of the Year *A Kirkus Reviews Best Book of The Year * Waterstones Book of the Year * Costa Book Award Finalist


“A novel of almost insolent ambition—lush and fantastical, a wild Eden behind a garden gate...it’s part ghost story and part natural history lesson, part romance and part feminist parable. I found it so transporting that 48 hours after completing it, I was still resentful to be back home.” —New York Times


London, 1893. When Cora Seaborne’s brilliant, domineering husband dies, she steps into her new life as a widow with as much relief as sadness: her marriage was an unhappy one, and she never suited the role of society wife. Seeking refuge in fresh air and open space, she leaves the metropolis for coastal Essex, accompanied by her inquisitive and obsessive eleven-year-old son, Francis, and the boy’s nanny, Martha, her fiercely protective friend. 


Once there, they hear rumors that after nearly three hundred years, the mythical Essex Serpent, a fearsome creature that once roamed the marshes, has returned. When a young man is mysteriously killed on New Year’s Eve, the community’s dread transforms to terror. Cora, a keen amateur naturalist with no patience for religion or superstition, is immediately enthralled, certain that what locals think is a magical sea beast may be a previously undiscovered species. 


Eager to investigate, she is introduced to parish vicar William Ransome, who is equally suspicious of the rumors but for different reasons: a man of faith, he is convinced the alarming reports are caused by moral panic, a flight from the correct and righteous path. As Cora and William attempt to discover the truth about the Essex Serpent’s existence, these seeming opposites find themselves inexorably drawn together in an intense relationship that will change both of them in ways entirely unexpected. And as they search for answers, Cora’s London past follows her to the coast, with striking consequences. 


Told with exquisite grace and intelligence, The Essex Serpent masterfully explores questions of science and religion, skepticism and faith, but it is most of all a celebration of love, and the many different—and surprising—guises it can take.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063252752.jpg,Sarah Perry,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,464,Tiếng Anh,Romance,https://www.fahasa.com/the-essex-serpent-tv-tie-in.html

Nobody Owens, known to his friends as Bod, is a normal boy. He would have been completely normal if he didn’t live in a sprawling graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor of the dead. There are dangers and adventures in the graveyard for a boy—an ancient Indigo Man beneath the hill, a gateway to a desert leading to an abandoned city of ghouls, the strange and terrible menace of the Sleer. But if Bod leaves the graveyard, then he will come under attack from the man Jack—who has already killed Bod’s family. . .

Discover how Brooks Running Company CEO Jim Weber transformed a failing business into a billion-dollar brand in the ultracompetitive global running market. 


This leadership memoir starts with Jim Weber's seventh-grade dream to run a successful company that delivered something people passionately valued. Fast forward to 2001, Jim Weber became the CEO of Brooks. He was on his way to fulfilling his dream, but he faced strong headwinds. Jim was the struggling brand's fourth CEO in two years, and the staff betting pool had him lasting four months. 


A lifelong competitor, Jim devised a one-page strategy that he believed would not only save the company but would also lay the foundation for Brooks to become a leading brand in the athletic, fitness, and outdoor categories. To succeed, Jim had to get his team to first believe it was possible and then employ the conviction, fortitude, and constancy of purpose to out-execute much larger brands. Brooks' success was validated when Warren Buffett made it a standalone Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary in 2012.


In the pages of Running with Purpose, you will find:

- The untold David vs. Goliath challenger brand story in which Brooks's bold strategy and unique brand positioning fueled its move from the back of the pack to lead.

- The key to building a purpose-driven brand that is oriented around customer obsession, building trust, competing with heart, and having fun along the way.

- The six clear leadership lessons Jim has learned along his path and applies at Brooks to help managers at all levels develop into authentic leaders.

- How Berkshire Hathaway's support and influence provided a tailwind for Brooks' business and brand to surge.

- A riveting inside look at the ups and downs of Jim's personal journey, which led to his conviction that life is too short not to enjoy what you do and the people by your side.

King crab fisherman Fox Thornton has a reputation as a sexy, carefree flirt. Everyone knows he’s a guaranteed good time—in bed and out—and that’s exactly how he prefers it. Until he meets Hannah Bellinger. She’s immune to his charm and looks, but she seems to enjoy his… personality? And wants to be friends? Bizarre. But he likes her too much to risk a fling, so platonic pals it is.


Now, Hannah's in town for work, crashing in Fox’s spare bedroom. She knows he’s a notorious ladies’ man, but they’re definitely just friends. In fact, she's nursing a hopeless crush on a colleague and Fox is just the person to help with her lackluster love life. Armed with a few tips from Westport’s resident Casanova, Hannah sets out to catch her coworker’s eye… yet the more time she spends with Fox, the more she wants him instead.

Sparks fly and things get real in this sharply sexy and whip-smart romantic comedy set against the backdrop of a post #metoo Hollywood from New York Times bestselling author Katie Cotugno


Former child actor Fiona St. James dropped out of the spotlight after a spectacularly public crash and burn. The tabloids called her crazy and self-destructive and said she’d lost her mind. Now in her late twenties, Fiona believes her humiliating past is firmly behind her. She’s finally regained a modicum of privacy, and she won’t let anything—or anyone—mess it up.


Unlike Fiona, Sam Fox, who played her older brother on the popular television show Birds of California, loves the perks that come with being a successful Hollywood actor: fame, women, parties, money. When his current show gets cancelled and his agent starts to avoid his calls, the desperate actor enthusiastically signs on for a Birds of California revival. But to make it happen, he needs Fiona St. James.


Against her better judgment, Fiona agrees to have lunch with Sam. What happens next takes them both by surprise. Sam is enthralled by Fiona’s take-no-prisoners attitude, and Fiona discovers a lovable goofball behind Sam’s close-up-ready face. Long drives to the beach, late nights at dive bars . . . theirs is the kind of kitschy romance Hollywood sells.

""I LOVED this novel....If you have ever sung along to a hit on the radio, in any decade, then you will devour Mary Jane at 45 rpm."" —Nick Hornby


Almost Famous meets Daisy Jones & The Six in this ""delightful"" (New York Times Book Review) novel about a fourteen-year-old girl’s coming of age in 1970s Baltimore, caught between her straight-laced family and the progressive family she nannies for—who happen to be secretly hiding a famous rock star and his movie star wife for the summer.


In 1970s Baltimore, fourteen-year-old Mary Jane loves cooking with her mother, singing in her church choir, and enjoying her family’s subscription to the Broadway Showtunes of the Month record club. Shy, quiet, and bookish, she’s glad when she lands a summer job as a nanny for the daughter of a local doctor. A respectable job, Mary Jane’s mother says. In a respectable house.


The house may look respectable on the outside, but inside it’s a literal and figurative mess: clutter on every surface, Impeachment: Now More Than Ever bumper stickers on the doors, cereal and takeout for dinner. And even more troublesome (were Mary Jane’s mother to know, which she does not): the doctor is a psychiatrist who has cleared his summer for one important job—helping a famous rock star dry out. A week after Mary Jane starts, the rock star and his movie star wife move in.


Over the course of the summer, Mary Jane introduces her new household to crisply ironed clothes and a family dinner schedule, and has a front-row seat to a liberal world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll (not to mention group therapy).

No one can call Vansh Raje’s life anything but charmed. Handsome—Vogue has declared him California’s hottest single—and rich enough to spend all his time on missions to make the world a better place. Add to that a doting family and a contagiously sunny disposition and Vansh has made it halfway through his twenties without ever facing anything to throw him off his admittedly spectacular game.

Two, to bring economic independence to millions of women in South Asia through her microfinance foundation and prove her father wrong about, well, everything.

The first comprehensive account of the biggest wake-up call in the history of the entertainment business: the pivot to streaming. Go inside a disparate group of media and tech companies -- Disney, Apple, AT&T/WarnerMedia, Comcast/NBCUniversal and well-funded startup Quibi – as they scramble to mount multi-billion-dollar challenges to Netflix.


After spotting Netflix and the deep-pocketed Amazon Prime Video a decade’s head start, rivals from the tech and start-up realm (Apple, Quibi) and traditional media (Disney, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal) all decided to move mountains to enter the streaming game. At a cost of billions, each went after their own piece of the market, launching five new services in a seven-month span. And just as the derby was heating up, the coronavirus pandemic arrived, a black-swan event bringing short-term benefits but also stiff challenges.


The battle for streaming supremacy may end up having more than one winner, but the cost and disruption to decades-old business models have also produced a lot of losers. Binge Times reveals the true costs of the vision quest as companies are turned inside-out and repeatedly redraw their org charts and strategic plans.

Davos Man: How The Billionaires Devoured The World,"Davos Man: How The Billionaires Devoured The World


A San Francisco Chronicle Bestseller


The New York Times’s Global Economics Correspondent masterfully reveals how billionaires’ systematic plunder of the world—brazenly accelerated during the pandemic—has transformed 21st-century life and dangerously destabilized democracy.


“Davos Man will be read a hundred years from now as a warning.” —Evan Osnos


“Excellent. A powerful, fiery book, and it could well be an essential one.”  —NPR.org


The history of the last half century in America, Europe, and other major economies is in large part the story of wealth flowing upward. The most affluent people emerged from capitalism’s triumph in the Cold War to loot the peace, depriving governments of the resources needed to serve their people, and leaving them tragically unprepared for the worst pandemic in a century.


Drawing on decades of experience covering the global economy, award-winning journalist Peter S. Goodman profiles five representative “Davos Men”—members of the billionaire class—chronicling how their shocking exploitation of the global pandemic has hastened a fifty-year trend of wealth centralization. Alongside this reporting, Goodman delivers textured portraits of those caught in Davos Man’s wake, including a former steelworker in the American Midwest, a Bangladeshi migrant in Qatar, a Seattle doctor on the front lines of the fight against COVID, blue-collar workers in the tenements of Buenos Aires, an African immigrant in Sweden, a textile manufacturer in Italy, an Amazon warehouse employee in New York City, and more.


Goodman’s revelatory exposé of the global billionaire class reveals their hidden impact on nearly every aspect of modern society: widening wealth inequality, the rise of anti-democratic nationalism, the shrinking opportunity to earn a livable wage, the vulnerabilities of our health-care systems, access to affordable housing, unequal taxation, and even the quality of the shirt on your back. Meticulously reported yet compulsively readable, Davos Man is an essential read for anyone concerned about economic justice, the capacity of societies to grapple with their greatest challenges, and the sanctity of representative government.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063078307.jpg,Peter S.

When that doesn’t work out, she decides that her best next step is to make a deal with God, so she heads over to her local mosque. The idealistic new imam, Ibrahim Sultan, is appalled by Jameela’s shallowness but agrees to assist her, on one condition—that she perform a good deed. 


Jameela reluctantly accepts his terms, kicking off a series of unfortunate events. The homeless man they try to help gets recruited by a terrorist group, causing federal authorities to become suspicious of Ibrahim. When the imam mysteriously disappears, Jameela is certain that the CIA has captured her new friend for interrogation and possibly torture. 


Despite having no talent for this sort of thing, Jameela decides to set off on a one-woman operation to rescue him. Her quest soon lands her at the center of an international plan targeting the leader of the terrorist organization—a scheme that puts Jameela and count-less others, including her hapless husband and clever but disapproving daughter, at risk.

When restructures, mergers, bankruptcies, and layoffs hit the workplace, employees and managers naturally find the resulting situational shifts to be challenging.

As veteran business consultant William Bridges explains, transition is successful when employees have a purpose, a plan, and a part to play.

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?


In this first volume of the full-color illustrated adaptation of his groundbreaking book, renowned historian Yuval Harari tells the story of humankind’s creation and evolution, exploring the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens challenges us to reconsider accepted beliefs, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and view specific events within the context of larger ideas.

"Sapiens: A Graphic History, Volume 2: The Pillars Of Civilization (Paperback)","Sapiens: A Graphic History, Volume 2: The Pillars Of Civilization


NATIONAL BESTSELLER


This second volume of Sapiens: A Graphic History, the full-color graphic adaptation of Yuval Noah Harari’s #1 New York Times bestseller, focuses on the Agricultural Revolution—when humans fell into a trap we’ve yet to escape: working harder and harder with diminishing returns.


What if humanity’s major woes—war, plague, famine and inequality—originated 12,000 years ago, when Homo sapiens converted from nomads to settlers, in pursuit of the fantasy of productivity and efficiency? What if by seeking to control plants and animals, humans ended up being controlled by kings, priests, and Kafkaesque bureaucracy? Volume 2 of Sapiens: A Graphic History–The Pillars of Civilization explores a crucial chapter in human development: the Agricultural Revolution. This is the story of how wheat took over the world; how an unlikely marriage between a god and a bureaucrat created the first empires; and how war, plague, famine, and inequality became an intractable feature of the human condition.


But it’s not all doom and gloom with this book’s cast of entertaining characters and colorful humorous scenes. Yuval, Zoe, Prof. Saraswati, Cindy and Bill (now farmers), Detective Lopez, and Dr. Fiction, all introduced in Volume 1, once again travel the length and breadth of human history, this time investigating the impact the Agricultural Revolution has had on our species. The cunning Mephisto shows them how to ensnare humans, King Hammurabi lays down the law, and Confucius explains harmonious society. The origins of modern farming are introduced through Elizabethan tragedy; the changing fortunes of domesticated plants and animals are tracked in the columns of the Daily Business News; the story of urbanization is portrayed as a travel brochure, offering discount journeys to ancient Babylon and China; and the history of inequality unfolds in a superhero detective story; with guest appearances by historical and cultural personalities throughout such as Thomas Jefferson, Scarlett O'Hara, Margaret Thatcher, and John Lennon.


Sapiens: A Graphic History, Volume 2 is a radical, witty and colorful retelling of the story of humankind for adults and young adults, and can be read on its own or in sequence with Volume I.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063212237.jpg,Yuval Noah Harari,HarperCollins Publishers,2021,256,Tiếng Anh,Graphic Novels: Literary & Memoirs,https://www.fahasa.com/sapiens-a-graphic-history-volume-2-the-pillars-of-civilization-paperback.html

Celebrated actor, personality, and all-around nerd, Wil Wheaton updates his memoir of collected blog posts with all new material and annotations as he reexamines one of the most interesting lives in Hollywood and fandom--and now for the first time in audio, narrated by Wil himself!


From starring in Stand by Me to playing Wesley Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation to playing himself, in his second (third?) iconic role of Evil Wil Wheaton in The Big Bang Theory, to becoming a social media supernova, Wil Wheaton has charted a career course unlike anyone else, and has emerged as one of the most popular and well respected names in science fiction, fantasy and pop culture.


Back in 2001, Wil began blogging on wilwheaton.net. Believing himself to have fallen victim to the curse of the child actor, Wil felt relegated to the convention circuit, and didn’t expect many would want to read about his random experiences and personal philosophies.


Yet, much to his surprise, people were reading. He still blogs, and now has an enormous following on social media with well over 3 million followers.


In Still Just a Geek, Wil revisits his 2004 collection of blog posts, Just a Geek, filled with insightful and often laugh-out-loud annotated comments, additional later writings, and all new material written for this publication. The result is an incredibly raw and honest memoir, in which Wil opens up about his life, about falling in love, about coming to grips with his past work, choices, and family, and finding fulfillment in the new phases of his career. From his times on the Enterprise to his struggles with depression to his starting a family and finding his passion--writing--Wil Wheaton is someone whose life is both a cautionary tale and a story of finding one’s true purpose that should resonate with fans and aspiring artists alike.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063080478.jpg,Wil Wheaton,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,464,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Arts & Entertainment,https://www.fahasa.com/still-just-a-geek-an-annotated-memoir.html

From bestselling author Sarah McCoy, a sun-splashed romp with a rich divorcée and her two wayward daughters in 1970s Mustique, the world’s most exclusive private island, where Princess Margaret and Mick Jagger were regulars and scandals stayed hidden from the press.


It’s January 1972 but the sun is white hot when Willy May Michael’s boat first kisses the dock of Mustique Isle. Tucked into the southernmost curve of the Caribbean, Mustique is a private island that has become a haven for the wealthy and privileged. Its owner is the eccentric British playboy Colin Tennant, who is determined to turn this speck of white sand into a luxurious neo-colonial retreat for his rich friends and into a royal court in exile for the Queen’s rebellious sister, Princess Margaret—one where Her Royal Highness can skinny dip, party, and entertain lovers away from the public eye.


Willy May, a former beauty queen from Texas—who is also no stranger to marital scandals—seeks out Mustique for its peaceful isolation. Determined to rebuild her life and her relationships with her two daughters, Hilly, a model, and Joanne, a musician, she constructs a fanciful white beach house across the island from Princess Margaret—and finds herself pulled into the island’s inner circle of aristocrats, rock stars, and hangers-on.


When Willy May’s daughters arrive, they discover that beneath its veneer of decadence, Mustique has a dark side, and like sand caught in the undertow, their mother-daughter story will shift and resettle in ways they never could have imagined.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063252202.jpg,Sarah McCoy,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,336,Tiếng Anh,Romance,https://www.fahasa.com/mustique-island.html

PIECES OF HER


What if the person you thought you knew best turns out to be someone you never knew at all . . . ?


Andrea knows everything about her mother, Laura. She knows she’s spent her whole life in the small beachside town of Belle Isle; she knows she’s never wanted anything more than to live a quiet life as a pillar of the community; she knows she’s never kept a secret in her life.

But all that changes when a trip to the mall explodes into violence and Andrea suddenly sees a completely different side to Laura. Because it turns out that before Laura was Laura, she was someone completely different. For nearly thirty years she’s been hiding from her previous identity, lying low in the hope that no one would ever find her. But now she’s been exposed, and nothing will ever be the same again.


The police want answers and Laura’s innocence is on the line, but she won’t speak to anyone, including her own daughter. Andrea is on a desperate journey following the breadcrumb trail of her mother’s past.

Most Anticipated of 2022 in The Millions, Ms. Magazine, LitHub


A young, mixed-race vampire must find a way to balance her deep-seated desire to live amongst humans with her incessant hunger in this stunning debut novel from a writer-to-watch.


Lydia is hungry. She's always wanted to try Japanese food. Sashimi, ramen, onigiri with sour plum stuffed inside - the food her Japanese father liked to eat. And then there is bubble tea and iced-coffee, ice cream and cake, and foraged herbs and plants, and the vegetables grown by the other young artists at the London studio space she is secretly squatting in. But, Lydia can't eat any of these things. Her body doesn't work like those of other people. The only thing she can digest is blood, and it turns out that sourcing fresh pigs' blood in London - where she is living away from her vampire mother for the first time - is much more difficult than she'd anticipated.


Then there are the humans - the other artists at the studio space, the people at the gallery she interns at, the strange men that follow her after dark, and Ben, a boyish, goofy-grinned artist she is developing feelings for. Lydia knows that they are her natural prey, but she can't bring herself to feed on them. In her windowless studio, where she paints and studies the work of other artists, binge-watches Buffy the Vampire Slayer and videos of people eating food on YouTube and Instagram, Lydia considers her place in the world. She has many of the things humans wish for - perpetual youth, near-invulnerability, immortality – but she is miserable; she is lonely; and she is hungry - always hungry.


As Lydia develops as a woman and an artist, she will learn that she must reconcile the conflicts within her - between her demon and human sides, her mixed ethnic heritage, and her relationship with food, and, in turn, humans - if she is to find a way to exist in the world. Before any of this, however, she must eat.


“Absolutely brilliant – tragic, funny, eccentric and so perfectly suited to this particularly weird time. Claire Kohda takes the vampire trope and makes it her own in a way that feels fresh and original. Serious issues of race, disability, misogyny, body image, sexual abuse are handled with subtlety, insight, and a lightness of touch. The spell this novel casts is so complete I feel utterly, and happily, bitten.” -- Ruth Ozeki, Booker-shortlisted author of A Tale for the Time Being",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063140882.jpg,Claire Kohda,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,240,Tiếng Anh,Horror,https://www.fahasa.com/woman-eating-a-literary-vampire-novel.html

What price would you pay for falling in love?


Rachel is a respected doctor who lives in a picturesque and affluent English village where her husband Nathan teaches at an elite private school. Competent, unflappable, and nearing 50, Rachel has everything in her life firmly in her control, even if some of its early luster has worn off. But one day a new patient arrives at her practice for emergency treatment.

A longtime patient appears to be following her every movement, turning up unexpectedly wherever she goes. Her somewhat estranged adult daughter Lizzie is hiding a secret—or at least, hiding it from Rachel. Nathan has grown sour and cold as well—or is that merely Rachel’s guilty conscience weighing on her?

""Chilling, thought-provoking, and hauntingly written, Mother May I kept me on the edge of my seat with its breathless race against time."" — Megan Miranda, New York Times bestselling author of The Girl from Widow Hills


Recommended by Buzzfeed • Parade • Country Living • Atlanta Journal-Constitution • Augusta Chronicle • The Nerd Daily • She Reads • BookBub • and more!


The New York Times bestselling author of the critically acclaimed Never Have I Ever returns with an even more addictive novel of domestic suspense in which a mother must decide how far she is willing to go to protect her child and the life she loves—an unforgettable tale of power, privilege, lies, revenge, and the choices we make, ones that transform our lives in unforeseen ways.


Revenge doesn’t wait for permission.


Growing up poor in rural Georgia, Bree Cabbat was warned that the world was a dark and scary place. Bree rejected that fearful outlook, and life has proved her right. Having married into a family with wealth, power, and connections, Bree now has all a woman could ever dream of.


Until the day she awakens and sees someone peering into her bedroom window—an old gray-haired woman dressed all in black who vanishes as quickly as she appears. It must be a play of the early morning light or the remnant of a waking dream, Bree tells herself, shaking off the bad feeling that overcomes her.


Later that day though, she spies the old woman again, in the parking lot of her daugh­ters’ private school . . . just minutes before Bree’s infant son, asleep in his car seat only a few feet away, vanishes. It happened so quickly—Bree looked away only for a second. There is a note left in his place, warning her that she is being watched; if she wants her baby back, she must not call the police or deviate in any way from the instructions that will follow.


The mysterious woman makes contact, and Bree learns she, too, is a mother. Why would another mother do this? What does she want? And why has she targeted Bree? Of course Bree will pay anything, do anything. It’s her child.


To get her baby back, Bree must complete one small—but critical—task. It seems harmless enough, but her action comes with a devastating price. 


Bree will do whatever it takes to protect her family—but what if the cost tears their world apart?",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780062855350.jpg,Joshilyn Jackson,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,352,Tiếng Anh,Thrillers,https://www.fahasa.com/mother-may-i.html

In 2001, when Madeleine Albright was leaving office as America’s first female secretary of state, interviewers asked her how she wished to be remembered. “I don’t want to be remembered,” she answered. “I am still here and have much more I intend to do. As difficult as it might seem, I want every stage of my life to be more exciting than the last.”


In that time of transition, the former Secretary considered the possibilities: she could write, teach, travel, give speeches, start a business, fight for democracy, help to empower women, campaign for favored political candidates, spend more time with her grandchildren. Instead of choosing one or two, she decided to do it all. For nearly twenty years, Albright was in constant motion, navigating half a dozen professions, clashing with presidents and prime ministers, learning every day. After leaving the State Department, she blazed her own trail—and gave voice to millions who yearn for respect, regardless of gender, background, or age.

Daughters Of The Occupation: A Novel Of WWII,"Daughters Of The Occupation: A Novel Of WWII


Inspired by true events in World War II Latvia, an emotionally charged novel of sacrifice, trauma, resilience, and survival, as witnessed by three generations of women. 


On one extraordinary day in 1940, Miriam Talan’s comfortable life is shattered. While she gives birth to her second child, a son she and her husband, Max, name Monya, the Soviets invade the Baltic state of Latvia and occupy the capital city of Riga, her home. Because the Talans are Jewish, the Soviets confiscate Max’s business and the family’s house and bank accounts, leaving them with nothing.


 Then, the Nazis arrive. They kill Max and begin to round up Jews. Fearing for her newborn son and her young daughter, Ilana, Miriam asks her loyal housekeeper to hide them and conceal their Jewish roots to keep them safe until the savagery ends.


 Three decades later, in Chicago, 24-year-old Sarah Byrne is mourning the untimely death of her mother, Ilana. Sarah’s estranged grandmother, Miriam, attends the funeral, opening the door to shocking family secrets. Sarah probes Miriam for information about the past, but it is only when Miriam is in the hospital, delirious with fever, that she begs Sarah to find the son she left behind in Latvia.


 Traveling to the Soviet satellite state, Sarah begins her search with the help of Roger, a charismatic Russian-speaking professor. But as they come closer to the truth, she realizes her quest may have disastrous consequences.


 A magnificent, emotionally powerful story of family and the lingering devastation of war, The Daughters of the Occupation explores how trauma is passed down in families and illuminates the strength and grace that can be shared by generations.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063226661.jpg,Shelly Sanders,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,400,Tiếng Anh,Historical Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/daughters-of-the-occupation-a-novel-of-wwii.html
Don't Trust Your Gut,"Don't Trust Your Gut


""Seth Stephens-Davidowitz is more than a data scientist. He is a prophet for how to use the data revolution to reimagine your life. Don’t Trust Your Gut is a tour de force—an intoxicating blend of analysis, humor, and humanity.” — Daniel H. Pink, #1 New York Times bestselling author of When, Drive, and To Sell Is Human


Big decisions are hard. We consult friends and family, make sense of confusing “expert” advice online, maybe we read a self-help book to guide us. In the end, we usually just do what feels right, pursuing high stakes self-improvement—such as who we marry, how to date, where to live, what makes us happy—based solely on what our gut instinct tells us. But what if our gut is wrong? Biased, unpredictable, and misinformed, our gut, it turns out, is not all that reliable. And data can prove this.


In Don’t Trust Your Gut, economist, former Google data scientist, and New York Times bestselling author Seth Stephens-Davidowitz reveals just how wrong we really are when it comes to improving our own lives. In the past decade, scholars have mined enormous datasets to find remarkable new approaches to life’s biggest self-help puzzles. Data from hundreds of thousands of dating profiles have revealed surprising successful strategies to get a date; data from hundreds of millions of tax records have uncovered the best places to raise children; data from millions of career trajectories have found previously unknown reasons why some rise to the top.


Telling fascinating, unexpected stories with these numbers and the latest big data research, Stephens-Davidowitz exposes that, while we often think we know how to better ourselves, the numbers disagree. Hard facts and figures consistently contradict our instincts and demonstrate self-help that actually works—whether it involves the best time in life to start a business or how happy it actually makes us to skip a friend’s birthday party for a night of Netflix on the couch. From the boring careers that produce the most wealth, to the old-school, data-backed relationship advice so well-worn it’s become a literal joke, he unearths the startling conclusions that the right data can teach us about who we are and what will make our lives better.


Lively, engrossing, and provocative, the end result opens up a new world of self-improvement made possible with massive troves of data. Packed with fresh, entertaining insights, Don’t Trust Your Gut redefines how to tackle our most consequential choices, one that hacks the market inefficiencies of life and leads us to make smarter decisions about how to improve our lives. Because in the end, the numbers don’t lie.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063239371.jpg,Seth Stephens-Davidowitz,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,307,Tiếng Anh,Behavioural Economics,https://www.fahasa.com/don-t-trust-your-gut.html

No matter how much advice we get or how much work we do on our “stuff,” nothing ever seems to make the difference. The truth of it is, you’re woefully ill-equipped for one of the most life-defining things you will ever take on—being in a committed relationship.

To her adoring fans, Emmy Jackson, aka @the_mamabare, is the honest “Instamum” who always tells it like it is.

""A pointed, punchy, and potent thriller...wry and clever, serious and exacting, and masterfully suspenseful.""--Booklist (starred review)


Big Little Lies meets The Witches of Eastwick—a gloriously entertaining and knife-sharp feminist revenge fantasy about three women whose midlife crisis brings unexpected new powers—putting them on a collision course with the evil that lurks in their wealthy beach town. 


In the Long Island oceanfront community of Mattauk, three different women discover that midlife changes bring a whole new type of empowerment…


After Nessa James’s husband dies and her twin daughters leave for college, she’s left all alone in a trim white house not far from the ocean. In the quiet of her late forties, the former nurse begins to hear voices. It doesn’t take long for Nessa to realize that the voices calling out to her belong to the dead—a gift she’s inherited from her grandmother, which comes with special responsibilities.


On the cusp of 50, suave advertising director Harriett Osborne has just witnessed the implosion of her lucrative career and her marriage. She hasn’t left her house in months, and from the outside, it appears as if she and her garden have both gone to seed. But Harriett’s life is far from over—in fact, she’s undergone a stunning and very welcome metamorphosis.


Ambitious former executive Jo Levison has spent thirty long years at war with her body. The free-floating rage and hot flashes that arrive with the beginning of menopause feel like the very last straw—until she realizes she has the ability to channel them, and finally comes into her power.


Guided by voices only Nessa can hear, the trio of women discover a teenage girl whose body was abandoned beside a remote beach. The police have written the victim off as a drug-addicted sex worker, but the women refuse to buy into the official narrative. Their investigation into the girl’s murder leads to more bodies, and to the town’s most exclusive and isolated enclave, a world of stupendous wealth where the rules don’t apply.

We Were Dreamers: An Immigrant Superhero Origin Story,"We Were Dreamers: An Immigrant Superhero Origin Story


INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER


The star of Marvel’s first Asian superhero film, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, tells his own origin story of being a Chinese immigrant, his battles with cultural stereotypes and his own identity, becoming a TV star, and landing the role of a lifetime.


In this honest, inspiring and relatable memoir, newly-minted superhero Simu Liu chronicles his family's journey from China to the bright lights of Hollywood with razor-sharp wit and humor.


Simu's parents left him in the care of his grandparents, then brought him to Canada when he was four. Life as a Canuck, however, is not all that it was cracked up to be; Simu's new guardians lack the gentle touch of his grandparents, resulting in harsh words and hurt feelings. His parents, on the other hand, find their new son emotionally distant and difficult to relate to - although they are related by blood, they are separated by culture, language, and values. 


As Simu grows up, he plays the part of the pious child flawlessly - he gets straight A's, crushes national math competitions and makes his parents proud. But as time passes, he grows increasingly disillusioned with the path that has been laid out for him. Less than a year out of college, at the tender age of 22, his life hits rock bottom when he is laid off from his first job as an accountant. Left to his own devices, and with nothing left to lose, Simu embarks on a journey that will take him far outside of his comfort zone into the world of show business. 


Through a swath of rejection and comical mishaps, Simu's determination to carve out a path for himself leads him to not only succeed as an actor, but also to open the door to reconciling with his parents.

Twelve And A Half: Leveraging The Emotional Ingredients Necessary For Business Success,"Twelve And A Half: Leveraging The Emotional Ingredients Necessary For Business Success


USA Today Bestseller


In his sixth business book, bestselling author, entrepreneur, and investor Gary Vaynerchuk explores the twelve essential emotional skills that are integral to his life—and business—success and provides today’s (and tomorrow’s) leaders with critical tools to acquire and develop these traits.


For decades, leaders have relied on “hard” skills to make smart decisions, while dismissing the importance of emotional intelligence. Soft skills like self-awareness and curiosity aren’t quantifiable; they can’t be measured on a spreadsheet and aren’t taught in B-schools or emphasized in institutions. We’ve been taught that emotional intelligence is a “nice to have” in business, not a requirement. But soft skills can actually accelerate business success, Gary Vaynerchuk argues. For analytical minds, it’s challenging to understand how to get “better” at being self-aware, curious, or empathetic—or even why it’s important to try. 


In this wise and practical book, Gary explores the 12 human ingredients that have led to his success and happiness and provides exercises to help you develop these traits yourself. He also shares what the “half” is—that emotional ingredient of leadership he’s weakest at and makes the most effort to improve. Working through the ideas and exercises in the book, he teaches you how to discover your own “halves” and offers insight on how to strengthen them. 


Gary’s secret to success is using these twelve traits in varying mixtures, depending on the situation. But how do we know when to balance patience with ambition? Humility with conviction? Gary provides real-life examples involving common business scenarios to show you how to use them together for optimum results. 


This iconoclastic book will help you refine your ingredients and improve your leadership capabilities. When implemented in the proper situation, these ingredients can help leaders land promotions, retain core employees, move faster than competitors, win the loyalty of customers, and build successful organizations that last.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063143791.jpg,Gary Vaynerchuk,HarperCollins Publishers,2021,224,Tiếng Anh,Advice On Careers & Achieving Success,https://www.fahasa.com/twelve-and-a-half-leveraging-the-emotional-ingredients-necessary-for-business-success.html

Sonya Curry chronicles the never-before-shared story of raising her children and her lifelong devotion to education, family, and faith.


Sonya Curry’s journey, like those of her extraordinary sons and daughter, was filled with defeats and hard-fought victories, but hers took place out of the limelight, without the eyes of the world watching, cheering, or drawing inspiration from her example. Until now.


In this inspiring memoir, Sonya tells her story for the first time, beginning with her childhood in rural Virginia and moving through the peaks and valleys of an incredible life—from raising her immensely gifted but sometimes headstrong children, to becoming an educator and founding a Montessori school, to discovering a profound, life sustaining connection to God and faith.

A Woman Of Endurance,"A Woman Of Endurance


Combining the haunting power of Toni Morrison’s Beloved with the evocative atmosphere of Phillippa Gregory’s A Respectable Trade, Dahlma Llanos-Figueroa’s groundbreaking novel illuminates a little discussed aspect of history—the Puerto Rican Atlantic Slave Trade—witnessed through the experiences of Pola, an African captive used as a breeder to bear more slaves.


A Woman of Endurance, set in nineteenth-century Puerto Rican plantation society, follows Pola, a deeply spiritual African woman who is captured and later sold for the purpose of breeding future slaves. The resulting babies are taken from her as soon as they are born. Pola loses the faith that has guided her and becomes embittered and defensive. The dehumanizing violence of her life almost destroys her. But this is not a novel of defeat but rather one of survival, regeneration, and reclamation of common humanity. 


Readers are invited to join Pola in her journey to healing. From the sadistic barbarity of her first experiences, she moves on to receive compassion and support from a revitalizing new community. Along the way, she learns to recognize and embrace the many faces of love—a mother’s love, a daughter’s love, a sister’s love, a love of community, and the self-love that she must recover before she can offer herself to another. It is ultimately, a novel of the triumph of the human spirit even under the most brutal of conditions.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780063255685.jpg,Dahlma Llanos-Figueroa,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,341,Tiếng Anh,Historical Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/a-woman-of-endurance.html

Ten years ago, the town's harvest failed utterly, and the people---believing the gods had abandoned them--left their farms and moved on.


Now, on a Friday before a long weekend, Regina ends her workday at an office in Makati, and walks home with a new colleague, Diana. Following a strange and disturbing conversation between them, Diana does not show up at work on Monday, nor Tuesday, nor Wednesday.


On Thursday, Regina finds a folded piece of paper In her bag. In Diana's handwriting are two names and a strange map that will send Regina back to her hometown. Here, in her quest to find Diana, she encounters rumors of genetic experiments, stumbles upon a strange facility that no one seems to know about, finds herself in places that don't exist, and discovers that people are not who they seem to be. And the biggest question in the bizarre chain of events is not what, or how, but why?


Wounded Little Gods is a tale that brings mythology to a sci-fi thriller that's filled with a sense of place--a place where gods are in many ways human and point to the ways in which humans can be inhumane. As Regina struggles to unwind the knots surrounding the mystery of this facility and the people connected to it. She discovers that she is more intertwined in the strange events in her hometown than she ever knew.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780804855228.jpg,Eliza Victoria,Berkeley Books,2022,160,Tiếng Anh,Fantasy,https://www.fahasa.com/wounded-little-gods-a-novel.html

Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention,"Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention - And How To Think Deeply Again


NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Our ability to pay attention is collapsing. From the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream and Lost Connections comes a groundbreaking examination of why this is happening—and how to get our attention back.


“The book the world needs in order to win the war on distraction.”—Adam Grant, author of Think Again


“Read this book to save your mind.”—Susan Cain, author of Quiet


In the United States, teenagers can focus on one task for only sixty-five seconds at a time, and office workers average only three minutes. Like so many of us, Johann Hari was finding that constantly switching from device to device and tab to tab was a diminishing and depressing way to live. He tried all sorts of self-help solutions—even abandoning his phone for three months—but nothing seemed to work. So Hari went on an epic journey across the world to interview the leading experts on human attention—and he discovered that everything we think we know about this crisis is wrong.


We think our inability to focus is a personal failure to exert enough willpower over our devices. The truth is even more disturbing: our focus has been stolen by powerful external forces that have left us uniquely vulnerable to corporations determined to raid our attention for profit. Hari found that there are twelve deep causes of this crisis, from the decline of mind-wandering to rising pollution, all of which have robbed some of our attention. In Stolen Focus, he introduces readers to Silicon Valley dissidents who learned to hack human attention, and veterinarians who diagnose dogs with ADHD. He explores a favela in Rio de Janeiro where everyone lost their attention in a particularly surreal way, and an office in New Zealand that discovered a remarkable technique to restore workers’ productivity.


Crucially, Hari learned how we can reclaim our focus—as individuals, and as a society—if we are determined to fight for it. Stolen Focus will transform the debate about attention and finally show us how to get it back.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780593138519.jpg,Johann Hari,Penguin Books,2022,368,Tiếng Anh,Memory Improvement & Thinking Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/stolen-focus-why-you-can-t-pay-attention.html

Whenever it started growing, it definitely bloomed the moment she and Kathleen Miller walked under the flashing neon sign of a lesbian bar called the Telegraph Club. Suddenly everything seemed possible. 


But America in 1954 is not a safe place for two girls to fall in love, especially not in Chinatown. Red-Scare paranoia threatens everyone, including Chinese Americans like Lily. With deportation looming over her father—despite his hard-won citizenship—Lily and Kath risk everything to let their love see the light of day.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780525555278.jpg,Malinda Lo,Penguin Books,2022,432,Tiếng Anh,Romance,https://www.fahasa.com/last-night-at-the-telegraph-club.html

After a narrow getaway from a blood- thirsty hollow, Jacob and Noor reunite with Miss Peregrine and the peculiar children in Devil's Acre. The Acre is being plagued by desolations--weather fronts of ash and blood and bone--a terrible portent of Caul's amassing army.


Risen from the Library of Souls and more powerful than ever, Caul and his apocalyptic agenda seem unstoppable. Only one hope remains--deliver Noor to the meeting place of the seven prophesied ones. If they can decipher its secret location.

A BuzzFeed Best Summer Read of 2021


When a fake relationship between scientists meets the irresistible force of attraction, it throws one woman's carefully calculated theories on love into chaos.


As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.


That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs.

Will,"Will


The instant #1 New York Times bestseller!


“It's the best memoir I've ever read.” —Oprah Winfrey


“Will Smith isn't holding back in his bravely inspiring new memoir . . . An ultimately heartwarming read, Will provides a humane glimpse of the man behind the actor, producer and musician, as he bares all his insecurities and trauma.” —USA Today


Winner of the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Achievement


One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.


Will Smith’s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic tale—but it’s only half the story.


Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over. 


This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781984879868.jpg,"Will Smith, Mark Manson",Penguin Books,2021,432,Tiếng Anh,Memoirs,https://www.fahasa.com/will.html
Where The Crawdads Sing,"Where The Crawdads Sing


NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE—The #1 New York Times bestselling worldwide sensation with more than 15 million copies sold, hailed by The New York Times Book Review as “a painfully beautiful first novel that is at once a murder mystery, a coming-of-age narrative and a celebration of nature.”


For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life—until the unthinkable happens.


Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780735219106.jpg,Delia Owens,Penguin Books,2021,400,Tiếng Anh,Crime,https://www.fahasa.com/where-the-crawdads-sing-404039.html

""Quick-paced, sharp, and thoroughly entertaining. I couldn’t put it down!”—Helen Hoang


Shake some hands. Kiss some coworkers.


Cutthroat political consultant Thom Morgan is thriving, working on the governor of California’s presidential campaign. If only he didn’t have to deal with Clay Parker, the infuriatingly smug data analyst who gets under Thom’s skin like it’s his job. In the midst of one of their heated and very public arguments, a journalist snaps a photo, but the image makes it look like they’re kissing.

Thom knows all about damage control—he practically invented it. Ever the professional, he’ll grin and bear this challenge as he does all others. But as the loyal staffers push the boundaries of “giving the people what they want,” the animosity between them blooms into something deeper and far more dangerous: desire.

Once upon a time, when her dad married Sage’s mom, Daisy was thrilled to get a bright and shiny new sister. But Sage was beautiful and popular, everything Daisy was not, and she made sure Daisy knew it.


Sage didn’t have Daisy’s smarts—she had to go back a grade to enroll in the fancy rich-kid school. So she used her popularity as a weapon, putting Daisy down to elevate herself. After the divorce, the stepsisters’ rivalry continued until the final, improbable straw: Daisy married Sage’s first love, and Sage fled California.


Eighteen years, two kids and one troubled marriage later, Daisy never expects—or wants—to see Sage again. But when the little sister they have in common needs them both, they put aside their differences to care for Cassidy. As long-buried truths are revealed, no one is more surprised than they when friendship blossoms.


Their fragile truce is threatened by one careless act that could have devastating consequences. They could turn their backs on each other again…or they could learn to forgive once and for all and finally become true sisters of the heart.

Return to Virgin River for the holidays in this uplifting tale from the beloved series by New York Times bestselling author Robyn Carr. Now a Netflix series!


Last Christmas Marcie Sullivan said a final goodbye to her husband, Bobby. This Christmas she’s come to Virgin River to find the man who saved his life and gave her three more years to love him.


Fellow marine Ian Buchanan dragged Bobby’s shattered body onto a medical transport in Fallujah four years ago, then disappeared as soon as their unit arrived stateside. Since then, Marcie’s letters to Ian have gone unanswered.


Marcie tracks Ian to the tiny mountain town of Virgin River and finds a man as wounded emotionally as Bobby was physically. But she is not easily scared off. As Marcie pushes her way into his rugged and reclusive life, she discovers a sweet but damaged soul beneath a rough exterior.


Ian doesn’t know what to make of the determined young widow who forces him to look into the painful past and, what’s worse, the uncertain future. But it is, after all, a season of miracles and maybe, just maybe, it’s time to banish the ghosts and open his heart.

In her first novel inspired by a true story, Jane Green re-imagines the life of troubled icon Talitha Getty in this transporting story from a forgotten chapter of the Swinging '60s
 
From afar Talitha's life seemed perfect. In her twenties, and already a famous model and actress, she moved from London to a palace in Marrakesh, with her husband Paul Getty, the famous oil heir. There she presided over a swirling ex-pat scene filled with music, art, free love and a counterculture taking root across the world.
 
When Claire arrives in London from her small town, she never expects to cross paths with a woman as magnetic as Talitha Getty. Yearning for the adventure and independence, she's swept off to Marrakesh, where the two become kindred spirits. But beneath Talitha's glamourous facade lurks a darkness few can understand. As their friendship blossoms and the two grow closer, the realities of Talitha's precarious existence set off a chain of dangerous events that could alter Claire's life forever.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781335425782.jpg,Jane Green,HarperCollins Publishers,2022,304,Tiếng Anh,Historical Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/sister-stardust.html

From the celebrated author of Inward comes a new collection of poetry and short prose focused on understanding how past wounds impact our present relationships.


In Clarity & Connection, Yung Pueblo describes how intense emotions accumulate in our subconscious and condition us to act and react in certain ways. In his characteristically spare, poetic style, he guides readers through the excavation and release of the past that is required for growth.

"Being Online: On Computing, Data, The Internet, And The Cloud","Being Online: On Computing, Data, The Internet, And The Cloud


A pioneer of cloud computing and big data offers his vision of the future world taking shape around us.


Jian Wang was the founder and architect of Alibaba's cloud and has been the driving force behind its technology innovations. He was also the founder of the City Brain initiative to develop a new digital infrastructure for sustainable cities. Being Online is his meditation on the moment we are in, as the digital era shifts to the internet era, spawning new innovations at a seemingly dizzying pace: cloud computing, 5G, artificial intelligence, big data, wearables, robots, virtual reality, the internet of things, blockchain, and more. For Wang, the invisible hand that connects them is being online. The conjunction of computing, data, and the internet has erased the difference between being online and off. When computing can be done in the cloud, it is on the road to becoming a utility. When data is connected, making it big, its usefulness multiplies exponentially in unforeseeable ways, as does its value.


This moment will be as transformative for humanity as Henry Ford's production line. Data is changing the nature of business. Computing is reshaping the economy. The cloud will help us do things we could never do before, at scales that were previously impossible. It will reshape our vision of the world, as electrification once did and, more recently, the transition from analog to digital. While telling the story of Alibaba's breakthroughs and the development of his own understanding of the internet, Jian Wang's visionary book lays out the implications of this shift and how to think about being online.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781951627799.jpg,Jian Wang,Simon And Schuster,2021,308,Tiếng Anh,"Media, Information & Communication Industries",https://www.fahasa.com/being-online.html

“If you loved the Hogwarts Library…you’ll be right at home at Summershall.” —Katherine Arden, New York Times bestselling author of The Bear and the Nightingale


From the New York Times bestselling author of An Enchantment of Ravens comes an “enthralling adventure” (Kirkus Reviews, starred review) about an apprentice at a magical library who must battle a powerful sorcerer to save her kingdom.


All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather.


Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire, and Elisabeth is implicated in the crime. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.


As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been taught—about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself.

Principles For Dealing With The Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed And Fail,"Principles For Dealing With The Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed And Fail


NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER


“A provocative read...There are few tomes that coherently map such broad economic histories as well as Mr. Dalio’s. Perhaps more unusually, Mr. Dalio has managed to identify metrics from that history that can be applied to understand today.” —Andrew Ross Sorkin, The New York Times


From legendary investor Ray Dalio, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Principles, who has spent half a century studying global economies and markets, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order examines history’s most turbulent economic and political periods to reveal why the times ahead will likely be radically different from those we’ve experienced in our lifetimes—and to offer practical advice on how to navigate them well.


A few years ago, Ray Dalio noticed a confluence of political and economic conditions he hadn’t encountered before. They included huge debts and zero or near-zero interest rates that led to massive printing of money in the world’s three major reserve currencies; big political and social conflicts within countries, especially the US, due to the largest wealth, political, and values disparities in more than 100 years; and the rising of a world power (China) to challenge the existing world power (US) and the existing world order. The last time that this confluence occurred was between 1930 and 1945. This realization sent Dalio on a search for the repeating patterns and cause/effect relationships underlying all major changes in wealth and power over the last 500 years.


In this remarkable and timely addition to his Principles series, Dalio brings readers along for his study of the major empires—including the Dutch, the British, and the American—putting into perspective the “Big Cycle” that has driven the successes and failures of all the world’s major countries throughout history. He reveals the timeless and universal forces behind these shifts and uses them to look into the future, offering practical principles for positioning oneself for what’s ahead.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781982160272.jpg,Ray Dalio,Simon And Schuster,2021,576,Tiếng Anh,Economic History,https://www.fahasa.com/principles-for-dealing-with-the-changing-world-order-why-nations-succeed-and-fail.html
Anxious People,"Anxious People


An instant #1 New York Times bestseller, the new novel from the author of A Man Called Ove is a “quirky, big-hearted novel….Wry, wise and often laugh-out-loud funny, it’s a wholly original story that delivers pure pleasure” (People).


Looking at real estate isn’t usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can’t fix their own marriage. There’s a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can’t seem to agree on anything. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment’s only bathroom, and you’ve got the worst group of hostages in the world.


Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.


Proving once again that Backman is “a master of writing delightful, insightful, soulful, character-driven narratives” (USA TODAY), Anxious People “captures the messy essence of being human….It’s clever and affecting, as likely to make you laugh out loud as it is to make you cry” (The Washington Post). This “endlessly entertaining mood-booster” (Real Simple) is proof that the enduring power of friendship, forgiveness, and hope can save us—even in the most anxious of times.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781501160844.jpg,Fredrik Backman,Simon And Schuster,2021,352,Tiếng Anh,Contemporary Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/anxious-people-402737.html
Think Like A Monk: Train Your Mind For Peace And Purpose Every Day,"Think Like A Monk: Train Your Mind For Peace And Purpose Every Day


Jay Shetty, social media superstar and host of the #1 podcast On Purpose, distills the timeless wisdom he learned as a monk into practical steps anyone can take every day to live a less anxious, more meaningful life.


When you think like a monk, you'll understand:

- How to overcome negativity

- How to stop overthinking

- Why comparison kills love

- How to use your fear

- Why you can't find happiness by looking for it

- How to learn from everyone you meet

- Why you are not your thoughts

- How to find your purpose

- Why kindness is crucial to success

-And much more...


Shetty grew up in a family where you could become one of three things-a doctor, a lawyer, or a failure. His family was convinced he had chosen option three: instead of attending his college graduation ceremony, he headed to India to become a monk, to meditate every day for four to eight hours, and devote his life to helping others. After three years, one of his teachers told him that he would have more impact on the world if he left the monk's path to share his experience and wisdom with others. Heavily in debt, and with no recognizable skills on his re sume , he moved back home in north London with his parents.


Shetty reconnected with old school friends-many working for some of the world's largest corporations-who were experiencing tremendous stress, pressure, and unhappiness, and they invited Shetty to coach them on well-being, purpose, and mindfulness. Since then, Shetty has become one of the world's most popular influencers. In 2017, he was named in the Forbes magazine 30-under-30 for being a game-changer in the world of media. In 2018, he had the #1 video on Facebook with over 360 million views. His social media following totals over 38 million, he has produced over 400 viral videos which have amassed more than 8 billion views, and his podcast, On Purpose, is consistently ranked the world's #1 Health and Wellness podcast.


In this inspiring, empowering book, Shetty draws on his time as a monk to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and power. Combining ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts and habits, and access the calm and purpose that lie within all of us. He transforms abstract lessons into advice and exercises we can all apply to reduce stress, improve relationships, and give the gifts we find in ourselves to the world. Shetty proves that everyone can-and should-think like a monk.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781982149819.jpg,Jay Shetty,Simon And Schuster,2020,352,Tiếng Anh,"Mind, Body, Spirit: Meditation & Visualisation",https://www.fahasa.com/think-like-a-monk-train-your-mind-for-peace-and-purpose-every-day.html

Zen Keys: A Guide To Zen Practice,"Zen Keys: A Guide To Zen Practice


Thich Nhat Hanh brings his warmth and clarity to this unique explication of Zen Buddhism. Beginning with a discussion of daily life in a Zen monastery, Nhat Hanh illustrates the character of Zen as practiced in Vietnam, and gives the reader clear explanations of the central elements of Zen practice and philosophy.


Thorough attention is given to concepts such as Awareness and Impermanence, and to contemporary issues such as the conflicts between modern technology and spirituality. The final section includes a set of 43 koans from the 13th century Vietnamese master, Tran Thai Tong, which are translated here for the first time into English.


Originally published in 1974, Zen Keys has been unavailable for several years but is now reissued by popular demand. Readers will find it as fresh today as when it was first written, and will be struck by the timelessness of its insights. What makes this work particularly compelling is that Nhat Hanh is able to invigorate what in other presentations may seem like empty abstract principles. The example he has set in his own life as a relentless advocate for peace brings strength and a realistic understanding to idealistic Buddhist goals.


In Zen Keys, Thich Nhat Hanh presents the philosophy which has enabled him to be mindful of peace in every moment. An excellent introduction from Philip Kapleau (author of the classic Three Pillars Of Zen ) provides background on the emerging American Zen tradition.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780385475617.jpg,"Thich Nhat Hanh, Philip Kapleau",Penguin Books,1994,198,Tiếng Anh,Zen Buddhism,https://www.fahasa.com/zen-keys-a-guide-to-zen-practice.html

One Buddha Is Not Enough: A Story Of Collective Awakening,"One Buddha Is Not Enough: A Story Of Collective Awakening


How do we learn to believe in ourselves and not just rely on our spiritual teachers? This question often directly posed to Thich Nhat Hanh as ""Who will be your successor?"" was answered in August of 2009 when over a thousand people came to Colorado to spend a week with Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh only to find he was in the hospital and wouldn’t be able to lead the retreat. The result of this event is One Buddha Is Not Enough, a book on how to become your own teacher and create your own community where you might least expect it.


One Buddha Is Not Enough offers fresh and original insight from emerging Buddhist teachers on topics such as how to handle grief, strengthen our relationships, deal with anger and other strong emotions, and find happiness in the present moment. Through letters, stories, poems, calligraphies, and photographs, Thich Nhat Hanh shares his unique insights on illness, health, and different healing modalities.


Far-reaching in its implication and tremendously encouraging, One Buddha Is Not Enough is a true expression of American Buddhism: We all already contain all the insight and wisdom we need. We are surrounded by the people who can help us on our journey. Sometimes all it takes is a wake up call to remind us of what we are capable of.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781935209638.jpg,Thich Nhat Hanh,Penguin Books,2006,224,Tiếng Anh,"Mind, Body, Spirit: Meditation & Visualisation",https://www.fahasa.com/one-buddha-is-not-enough-a-story-of-collective-awakening.html

How To Think Like A Fish: And Other Lessons From A Lifetime In Angling,"How To Think Like A Fish: And Other Lessons From A Lifetime In Angling


Jeremy Wade has caught an unparalleled array of outsize and outlandish fish from challenging locations all over the world - goliath tigerfish from the Congo, arapaima from the Amazon, 'giant devil catfish' from the Himalayan foothills . . .


As his catches attract increasing public attention, many people ask him how they can improve their own fishing results.


This book is his reply. Sparse on the details of technique, it's about the simple, fundamental principles - a mindset for success. Part science, part art, and part elusive something else, this, he says, is within every angler's ability to develop.


How to Think Like a Fishis the distillation of a life spent fishing. Along the way readers will learn when to let instinct override logic. Why less time can bring better results than more. Which details are vital and which may be irrelevant. And how a 'non-result' can be a result.


Thoughtful and funny, brimming with wisdom and adventure, here is the book for any angler - novice or old hand - who wants to catch the fish that have so far eluded them.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781474604864_1.jpg,"Wade, Jeremy",Hachette UK Distribution,2020,272,Tiếng Anh,Memoirs,https://www.fahasa.com/how-to-think-like-a-fish-and-other-lessons-from-a-lifetime-in-angling-396215.html

"Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, And The Gates Foundation Rock The World With OKRs","Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, And The Gates Foundation Rock The World With OKRs


INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER


'For anyone interested in becoming a better manager' - Bill Gates


--------


Discover the revolutionary movement behind the explosive growth of Intel, Google, Amazon and Uber.


In 1999, legendary venture capitalist John Doerr invested nearly $12 million in a small 40-person startup that had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. Doerr introduced the founders to his system of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and, with those principles at the foundation of their management, the startup grew at an exponential rate. Today, that same startup - Google - has more than 70,000 employees with a market cap exceeding $600 billion.


Doerr has introduced OKRs to more than fifty companies, helping tech giants and charities exceed all expectations. In the OKR model, objectives define what we seek to achieve and key results are how those top­ priority goals will be attained. They focus effort, foster coordination and enhance workplace satisfaction. For the first time in Measure What Matters, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the agility and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations.


With a foreword by Larry Page, and contributions from Bono and Bill Gates, this book will show you how to collect timely, relevant data to track progress - to measure what matters. It will help any organization or team aim high, move fast, and excel.

'Management magic....Measure What Matters is a must read for anyone motivated to improve their organization' - Former Vice President Al Gore, chairman of the Climate Reality Project


'Measure What Matters shows how any organization or team can aim high, move fast, and excel' - Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO


'Measure What Matters deserves to be fully embraced by every person responsible for performance in any walk of life' - Jim Collins, author of Good to Great

Sapiens A Graphic History Volume 2,"Sapiens A Graphic History Volume 2


100 Things To Know About The OceansDiscover the second volume of an epic, beautifully illustrated graphic history of humankind, based on Yuval Noah Harari's multi-million copy bestselling phenomenon.


When nomadic Homo sapiens settled to live in one place, they started working harder and harder. But why didn't they get a better life in return?


In The Pillars of Civilization, Yuval Noah Harari and his companions including Prof. Saraswati and Dr. Fiction travel the length and breadth of human history to investigate how the Agricultural Revolution changed society forever. Discover how wheat took over the world, how war, famine, disease and inequality became a part of the human condition, and why we might only have ourselves to blame.


The origins of modern farming are told through Elizabethan tragedy, the changing fortunes of domesticated plants and animals are tracked in the columns of the Daily Business News, and the history of inequality is revealed in a superhero detective story.


A radical, witty and colourful retelling of the story of humankind, adapted from Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Volume 2 can be read as a standalone or as a follow-up to Volume 1, The Birth of Humankind.


Praise for Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens:


'I would recommend Sapiens to anyone who's interested in the history and future of our species.' Bill Gates


'Interesting and provocative... It gives you a sense of how briefly we've been on this Earth' Barack Obama


'Jaw-dropping from the first word to the last... It may be the best book I've ever read' Chris Evans


'Contains a remarkable piece of information on almost every page and reminds us that we should be grateful to be human.' Matt Haig


'Sweeps the cobwebs out of your brain... Radiates power and clarity, making the world strange and new' Sunday Times


'Provocative and fascinating and opinionated...it makes the familiar seem unfamiliar. It altered how I view our species and our world.'

for adult and young adult readers alike.


One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?


In this first volume of the full-color illustrated adaptation of his groundbreaking book, renowned historian Yuval Harari tells the story of humankind’s creation and evolution, exploring the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, 
Sapiens 
challenges us to reconsider accepted beliefs, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and view specific events within the context of larger ideas. 


Featuring 256 pages of full-color illustrations and easy-to-understand text covering the first part of the full-length original edition, this adaptation of the mind-expanding book furthers the ongoing conversation as it introduces Harari’s ideas to a wide new readership.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781787332812_1.jpg,Yuval Noah Harari,Grantham Book Services,2020,248,Tiếng Anh,Graphic Novels: True Stories & Non-fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/sapiens-a-graphic-history-the-birth-of-humankind-volume-1.html

A Best Book of 2020 * Entertainment Weekly * Washington Post * O Magazine * New York Times Book Review * Publishers Weekly * NPR * The Economist * Shelf Awareness * Library Journal * St. Louis Post-Dispatch * Slate


Finalist for the 2021 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction


A deeply personal work about identity and belonging in a nation coming apart at the seams, 
Homeland Elegies
 blends fact and fiction to tell an epic story of longing and dispossession in the world that 9/11 made. Part family drama, part social essay, part picaresque novel, at its heart it is the story of a father, a son, and the country they both call home.


Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ayad Akhtar forges a new narrative voice to capture a country in which debt has ruined countless lives and the gods of finance rule, where immigrants live in fear, and where the nation's unhealed wounds wreak havoc around the world. Akhtar attempts to make sense of it all through the lens of a story about one family, from a heartland town in America to palatial suites in Central Europe to guerrilla lookouts in the mountains of Afghanistan, and spares no one—least of all himself—in the process.

Kay’s Anatomy: A Complete (And Completely Disgusting) Guide To The Human Body,"Kay’s Anatomy: A Complete (And Completely Disgusting) Guide To The Human Body


THE RECORD-BREAKING NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER FROM THE UK'S BESTSELLING NON-FICTION AUTHOR.


Discover all the weird and wonderful things that go on inside your body with Dr Adam Kay. 
Covers key stage 2 / 3 human biology syllabus (in a slightly repulsive way).


'Hilarious and fascinating! I wish Adam had been my biology teacher' -
 Konnie Huq


Do you ever think about your body and how it all works? Like really properly think about it? The human body is extraordinary and fascinating and, well . . . pretty weird. Yours is weird, mine is weird, your maths teacher's is even weirder.


This book is going to tell you what's actually going on in there, and answer the really important questions, like:


Are bogeys safe to eat?
 Look, if your nose is going to all that effort of creating a snack, the least we can do is check out its nutritional value. (Yes, they're safe. Chew away!)


And how much of your life will you spend on the toilet? 
About a year - so bring a good book. (I recommend this one.)


So sit back, relax, put on some rubber gloves, and let a doctor take you on a poo (and puke) filled tour of your insides. Welcome to Kay's Anatomy*.


*a fancy word for your body. See, you're learning already.

The Puzzle Solver: A Scientist's Desperate Quest To Cure the Illness That Stole His Son,"The Puzzle Solver: A Scientist's Desperate Quest To Cure the Illness That Stole His Son


""A renowned geneticist races against time to diagnose a malady that landed at his door... A complex, well-related story of medical detective work."" --KIRKUS


At the age of twenty-seven, Whitney Dafoe was forced to give up his life as a photographer who traveled the world. Bit by bit a mysterious illness stole away the pieces of his life: First, it took the strength of his legs, then his voice, and his ability to eat. Finally, even the sound of a footstep in his room became unbearable. 
The Puzzle Solver
 follows several years in which he desperately sought answers from specialist after specialist, where at one point his 6'3"" frame dropped to 115 lbs. For years, he underwent endless medical tests, but doctors told him there was nothing wrong. Then, finally, a diagnosis: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis.


In the 80s, when an outbreak of people immobilized by an indescribable fatigue were reported near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, doctors were at a loss to explain the symptoms. The condition would alternatively be nicknamed Raggedy Ann Syndrome or the Yuppie Disease, and there was no cure or answers about treatment. They were to remain sick.


But there was one answer: Whitney's father, Ron Davis, PhD, a world-class geneticist at Stanford University whose legendary research helped crack the code of DNA, suddenly changed the course of his career in a race against time to cure his son's debilitating condition.


In 
The Puzzle Solver
, journalist Tracie White, who first wrote a viral and award-winning piece on Davis and his family in 
Stanford Medicine
, tells his story. In gripping prose, she masterfully takes readers along on this journey with Davis to solve one of the greatest mysteries in medicine. In a piercing investigative narrative, closed doors are opened, and masked truths are exposed as Davis uncovers new proof confirming that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a biological disease.


At the heart of this book is a moving story that goes far beyond medicine, this is a story about how the power of love -- and science -- can shine light in even the darkest, most hidden, corners of the world.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_243988.jpg,Tracie White,Hachette Book Group,2021,240,Tiếng Anh,Advice On Parenting,https://www.fahasa.com/the-puzzle-solver-a-scientist-s-desperate-quest-to-cure-the-illness-that-stole-his-son.html
You Lead: How Being Yourself Makes You A Better Leader,"You Lead: How Being Yourself Makes You A Better Leader


Your biggest asset in leadership is you. How can you expect people to trust and believe in you, if you aren't truthful and don't embrace your whole self at work?


There is a need for a new kind of leadership; one that bleeds personality and rings true to employees and customers alike who crave authenticity.
 You Lead 
argues that business leaders deliver superior results, communities of engagement both inside and outside of the company and true values-driven success when they are themselves and come across as genuine.


Bestselling author, 
Minter Dial
, shows readers how embracing your whole self at work encourages people to also be themselves, seek true fulfilment at work and merge the personal and professional to become true examples of what you stand for. 
You Lead
 is a call to arms to leaders to stop pretending to be who they are not, and play on their uniqueness and strengths, to allow people to do the same and develop a culture of authenticity and purpose.


With practical advice, real-life stories and a simple framework, this book shows you how you can:


- Be yourself, lead by example and merge the professional and personal

- Stand for something and allow people to develop true purpose at work

- Allow a community to flourish through the right kind of governance model

- Radiate your purpose through employees and customers alike for long-term performance",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_244385.jpg,Minter Dial,Grantham Book Services,2021,230,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/you-lead-how-being-yourself-makes-you-a-better-leader.html
The Infinite Leader: Balancing The Demands Of Modern Business Leadership (Kogan Page Inspire),"The Infinite Leader: Balancing The Demands Of Modern Business Leadership (Kogan Page Inspire)


WINNER: 
Independent Press Awards 2021 - Leadership


Bestselling and award-winning author duo Chris Lewis and Pippa Malmgren are calling it out. In 
The Infinite Leader
, they argue that the spectacular leadership failures that we have witnessed in recent history, stretching across business, community life and politics, can be explained by a lack of balance.


Having spent centuries perfecting processes and systems to maximize productivity and being indicted to the shrine of numbers, KPI's and financial forecasting, we have to admit, there are very few examples of sustainable and inspirational leadership figures out there. By over-relying on the hard stuff, we have disregarded whole dimensions of values that are desperately needed when trying to engage communities of people towards a common goal.


The Infinite Leader
 is a roadmap to introducing balance back into organizations. You can adapt your stance to the infinite possibilities facing you as a leader, and balance the main quadrants of the rational, emotional, spiritual and physical leader, to deliver sustainable leadership with integrity. Business is still about people - people operate across paradoxes and opposing forces, in a world that confounds these influences. Leaders need to continuously juggle and neutralize these to succeed. Be what your people need you to be and learn what they don't teach you in business schools; remain analytical and numbers-focused when needed, but also bring your heart, person and integrity to leadership.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_244009.jpg,"Chris Lewis, Pippa Malmgren",Grantham Book Services,2020,248,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/the-infinite-leader-balancing-the-demands-of-modern-business-leadership-kogan-page-inspire.html

A 
New York Times
 Bestseller and 
#1 Indie Bestseller


This lyrical, stunning picture book tells a story about learning to love and celebrate your Asian-shaped eyes, in the spirit of 
Hair Love
 by Matthew A. Cherry, and is a celebration of diversity.


A young Asian girl notices that her eyes look different from her peers'. They have big, round eyes and long lashes. She realizes that her eyes are like her mother’s, her grandmother's, and her little sister's. They have eyes that kiss in the corners and glow like warm tea, crinkle into crescent moons, and are filled with stories of the past and hope for the future.


Drawing from the strength of these powerful women in her life, she recognizes her own beauty and discovers a path to self-love and empowerment. This powerful, poetic picture book will resonate with readers of all ages.

SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2021 CARNEGIE MEDAL IN NON-FICTION


'This will be read for many, many years to come as a classic not just of the memoir genre but of contemporary writing' Simon Schama


'The work of a poet. A great poet' 
Financial Times


'A must-read classic' Mary Karr


'Trethewey writes elegantly, trenchantly, intimately as well about the fraught history of the south and what it means live at the intersection of America's struggle between blackness and whiteness. And what, in our troubled republic, is a subject more evergreen?' Mitchell S. Jackson


Natasha Trethewey was born in Mississippi in the 60s to a black mother and a white father. When she was six, Natasha's parents divorced, and she and her mother moved to Atlanta. There, her mother met the man who would become her second husband, and Natasha's stepfather.


While she was still a child, Natasha decided that she would not tell her mother about what her stepfather did when she was not there: the quiet bullying and control, the games of cat and mouse. Her mother kept her own secrets, secrets that grew harder to hide as Natasha came of age.


When Natasha was nineteen and away at college, her stepfather shot her mother dead on the driveway outside their home.


With penetrating insight and a searing voice that moves from the wrenching to the elegiac, 
Memorial Drive
 is a compelling and searching look at a shared human experience of sudden loss and absence, and a piercing glimpse at the enduring ripple effects of white racism and domestic abuse. Luminous, urgent, and visceral, it cements Trethewey's position as one of the most important voices in America today.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_243677.jpg,Natasha Trethewey,HarperCollins Publishers,2020,224,Tiếng Anh,Biography: General,https://www.fahasa.com/memorial-drive-a-daughter-s-memoir.html
Joe Biden: A Life Of Trial And Redemption,"Joe Biden: A Life Of Trial And Redemption


Newly updated, the definitive biography of the President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden, which examines the fascinating life of a man who has shaped Washington politics for more than four decades and will now enter the White House as President in his own right.


Raised in the working-class towns of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington, Delaware, and with lackluster grades in school and no particular goals, Joe Biden shocked the nation in 1972 when he became one of the youngest elected senators in U.S. history. Over the course of four decades, he carved a legacy for himself as one of the most respected legislators in the country, and was a close friend and partner to President Barack Obama, who valued his vice president's vast experience in domestic and foreign affairs.


Yet Biden's political success has been matched by personal tragedy and countless challenges. Within two months of being elected in 1972, Biden lost his wife, Neilia, and his young daughter in a tragic accident--a loss that brought him to the nadir of despair and shook his resolve to stay in politics. He suffered two brain aneurysms and career-threatening gaffes and miscues. In 2015, he lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer.


Biden then faced the biggest challenge of his political career as the Democratic nominee for the 2020 elections and won both the electoral college and popular vote. He is now poised to enter the White House once more--this time as President--at a time of great global uncertainty. Based on exhaustive research by one of Washington's most prolific journalists, including numerous exclusive interviews with Biden's confidants and family members, as well as President Obama and the President-elect himself, 
Joe Biden

Barack And Joe: The Making Of An Extraordinary Partnership,"Barack And Joe: The Making Of An Extraordinary Partnership


The extraordinary partnership of Barack Obama and Joe Biden is unique in American history. The two men, their characters and styles sharply contrasting, formed a dynamic working relationship that evolved into a profound friendship. Their affinity was not predestined. Obama and Biden began wary of each other: Obama an impatient freshman disdainful of the Senate's plodding ways; Biden a veteran of the chamber and proud of its traditions.Gradually they came to respect each other's values and strengths and rode into the White House together in 2008. Side-by-side through two tension-filled terms, they shared the day-to-day joys and struggles of leading the most powerful nation on earth. They accommodated each other's quirks: Biden's famous miscues kept coming, and Obama overlooked them knowing they were insignificant except as media fodder. With his expertise in foreign affairs and legislative matters, Biden took on an unprecedented role as chief adviser to Obama, reshaping the vice presidency. Together Obama and Biden guided Americans through a range of historic moments: a devastating economic crisis, racial confrontations, war in Afghanistan, and the dawn of same-sex marriage nationwide. They supported each other through highs and lows: Obama provided a welcome shoulder during the illness and death of Biden's son Beau.As many Americans turn a nostalgic eye toward the Obama presidency, Barack and Joe offers a new look at this administration, its absence of scandal, dedication to truth, and respect for the media. This is the first book to tell the full story of this historic relationship and its substantial impact on the Obama presidency and its legacy.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_243672.jpg,"Steven Levingston, Michael Dyson",Hachette Book Group,2020,352,Tiếng Anh,"Biography: Historical, Political & Military",https://www.fahasa.com/barack-and-joe-the-making-of-an-extraordinary-partnership.html

Follow along as this 
New York Times
 bestselling author details the astonishing scientific discovery of the code to unleashing the human immune system to fight in this ""captivating and heartbreaking"" book (
The Wall Street Journal
).


For decades, scientists have puzzled over one of medicine's most confounding mysteries: Why doesn't our immune system recognize and fight cancer the way it does other diseases, like the common cold?


As it turns out, the answer to that question can be traced to a series of tricks that cancer has developed to turn off normal immune responses -- tricks that scientists have only recently discovered and learned to defeat. The result is what many are calling cancer's ""penicillin moment,"" a revolutionary discovery in our understanding of cancer and how to beat it.


In

, 
New York Times 
bestselling author of 
The Good Nurse 
Charles Graeber guides readers through the revolutionary scientific research bringing immunotherapy out of the realm of the miraculous and into the forefront of twenty-first-century medical science. As advances in the fields of cancer research and the human immune system continue to fuel a therapeutic arms race among biotech and pharmaceutical research centers around the world, the next step -- harnessing the wealth of new information to create modern and more effective patient therapies -- is unfolding at an unprecedented pace, rapidly redefining our relationship with this all-too-human disease.

War between the devas and the demons is imminent, and the Otherworld is on high alert. Fourteen-year-old Aru Shah and her friends are sent on a mission to rescue two ""targets,"" one of whom is about to utter a prophecy that could mean the difference between victory and defeat. Turns out the targets, a pair of twins, are the newest Pandava sisters, though the prophecy says that one sister is not true.


When the Pandavas fail to prevent the prophecy from reaching the Sleeper's ears, the heavenly attendants ask them to step aside. Aru believes that the only way to put the shine back on their brand is to find the Kalpavriksha, the wish-granting tree that came out of the Ocean of Milk when it was churned. If she can reach it before the Sleeper, perhaps she can turn everything around with one wish.

Named one of 100 Best Fantasy Books of All Time by 
Time
 magazine!


Twelve-year-old Aru Shah has a tendency to stretch the truth in order to fit in at school. While her classmates are jetting off to family vacations in exotic locales, she'll be spending her autumn break at home, in the Museum of Ancient Indian Art and Culture, waiting for her mom to return from her latest archeological trip. Is it any wonder that Aru makes up stories about being royalty, traveling to Paris, and having a chauffeur?


One day, three schoolmates show up at Aru's doorstep to catch her in a lie. They don't believe her claim that the museum's Lamp of Bharata is cursed, and they dare Aru to prove it. 
Just a quick light, 
Aru thinks. Then she can get herself out of this mess and 
never ever
 fib again.


But lighting the lamp has dire consequences. She unwittingly frees the Sleeper, an ancient demon whose duty it is to awaken the God of Destruction. Her classmates and beloved mother are frozen in time, and it's up to Aru to save them.


The only way to stop the demon is to find the reincarnations of the five legendary Pandava brothers, protagonists of the Hindu epic poem, the 
Mahabharata
, and journey through the Kingdom of Death. But how is one girl in Spider-Man pajamas supposed to do all 
that
?

Zeus has punished his son Apollo--god of the sun, music, archery, poetry, and more--by casting him down to earth in the form of a gawky, acne-covered sixteen-year-old mortal named Lester.


The only way Apollo can reclaim his rightful place on Mount Olympus is by restoring several Oracles that have gone dark. What is affecting the Oracles, and how can Apollo/Lester do anything about them without his powers?


After experiencing a series of dangerous--and frankly, humiliating--trials at Camp Half-Blood, Lester must now leave the relative safety of the demigod training ground and embark on a hair-raising journey across North America.


Somewhere in the American Midwest, he and his companions must find the most dangerous Oracle from ancient times: a haunted cave that may hold answers for Apollo in his quest to become a god again--if it doesn't kill him or drive him insane first.

Dragon Pearl,"Dragon Pearl


Best-selling author Rick Riordan presents Yoon Ha Lee's space opera about thirteen-year-old Min, who comes from a long line of fox spirits.


But you’d never know it by looking at her. To keep the family safe, Min’s mother insists that none of them use any fox-magic, such as Charm or shape-shifting. They must appear human at all times.


Min feels hemmed in by the household rules and resents the endless chores, the cousins who crowd her, and the aunties who judge her. She would like nothing more than to escape Jinju, her neglected, dust-ridden, and impoverished planet. She’s counting the days until she can follow her older brother, Jun, into the Space Forces and see more of the Thousand Worlds.


When word arrives that Jun is suspected of leaving his post to go in search of the Dragon Pearl, Min knows that something is wrong. Jun would never desert his battle cruiser, even for a mystical object rumored to have tremendous power. She decides to run away to find him and clear his name.


Min’s quest will have her meeting gamblers, pirates, and vengeful ghosts. It will involve deception, lies, and sabotage. She will be forced to use more fox-magic than ever before, and to rely on all of her cleverness and bravery. The outcome may not be what she had hoped, but it has the potential to exceed her wildest dreams.

"Breath From Salt: A Deadly Genetic Disease, A New Era In Science, And The Patients And Families Who Changed Medicine Forever","Breath From Salt: A Deadly Genetic Disease, A New Era In Science, And The Patients And Families Who Changed Medicine Forever


Recommended by Bill Gates and included in GatesNotes


""Elaborating on the science as well as the business behind the fight against cystic fibrosis, Trivedi captures the emotions of the families, doctors, and scientists involved in the clinical trials and their 'weeping with joy' as new drugs are approved, and shows how cystic fibrosis, once a 'death sentence,' became, for many, a manageable condition. This is a rewarding and challenging work."" 
—
Publishers Weekly


Cystic fibrosis was once a mysterious disease that killed infants and children. Now it could be the key to healing millions with genetic diseases of every type—from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's to diabetes and sickle cell anemia.


In 1974, Joey O'Donnell was born with strange symptoms. His insatiable appetite, incessant vomiting, and a relentless cough—which shook his tiny, fragile body and made it difficult to draw breath—confounded doctors and caused his parents agonizing, sleepless nights. After six sickly months, his salty skin provided the critical clue: he was one of thousands of Americans with cystic fibrosis, an inherited lung disorder that would most likely kill him before his first birthday.


The gene and mutation responsible for CF were found in 1989—discoveries that promised to lead to a cure for kids like Joey. But treatments unexpectedly failed and CF was deemed incurable. It was only after the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a grassroots organization founded by parents, formed an unprecedented partnership with a fledgling biotech company that transformative leaps in drug development were harnessed to produce groundbreaking new treatments: pills that could fix the crippled protein at the root of this deadly disease.


From science writer Bijal P. Trivedi, 
Breath from Salt 
chronicles the riveting saga of cystic fibrosis, from its ancient origins to its identification in the dank autopsy room of a hospital basement, and from the CF gene's celebrated status as one of the first human disease genes ever discovered to the groundbreaking targeted genetic therapies that now promise to cure it.


Told from the perspectives of the patients, families, physicians, scientists, and philanthropists fighting on the front lines, 
Breath from Salt
 is a remarkable story of unlikely scientific and medical firsts, of setbacks and successes, and of people who refused to give up hope—and a fascinating peek into the future of genetics and medicine.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_241515.jpg,Bijal P.

Named one of the most important nonfiction books of the 21st century by

Chronicle of Higher Education‚
Literary Hub
, 
Book Riot‚
 and 
Zora


A tenth-anniversary edition of the iconic bestseller—“one of the most influential books of the past 20 years,” according to the 
Chronicle of Higher Education
—with a new preface by the author


“It is in no small part thanks to Alexander’s account that civil rights organizations such as Black Lives Matter have focused so much of their energy on the criminal justice system.”


—Adam Shatz, 
London Review of Books


Seldom does a book have the impact of Michelle Alexander’s 
The New Jim Crow
. Since it was first published in 2010, it has been cited in judicial decisions and has been adopted in campus-wide and community-wide reads; it helped inspire the creation of the Marshall Project and the new $100 million Art for Justice Fund; it has been the winner of numerous prizes, including the prestigious NAACP Image Award; and it has spent nearly 250 weeks on the 
New York Times
 bestseller list.


Most important of all, it has spawned a whole generation of criminal justice reform activists and organizations motivated by Michelle Alexander’s unforgettable argument that “we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it.” As the 
Birmingham News
proclaimed, it is “undoubtedly the most important book published in this century about the U.S.”


Now, ten years after it was first published, The New Press is proud to issue a tenth-anniversary edition with a new preface by Michelle Alexander that discusses the impact the book has had and the state of the criminal justice reform movement today.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_241297.jpg,Michelle Alexander,Ingram Academic Services,2020,352,Tiếng Anh,Laws Of Specific Jurisdictions,https://www.fahasa.com/the-new-jim-crow.html

The fate of peculiardom hangs in the balance in this epic conclusion to the #1 bestselling Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children series.


The last thing Jacob Portman saw before the world went dark was a terrible, familiar face.


Suddenly, he and Noor are back in the place where everything began-his grandfather's house. Jacob doesn't know how they escaped from V's loop to find themselves in Florida. But he does know one thing for certain: Caul has returned.


After a narrow getaway from a blood- thirsty hollow, Jacob and Noor reunite with Miss Peregrine and the peculiar children in Devil's Acre. The Acre is being plagued by desolations-weather fronts of ash and blood and bone-a terrible portent of Caul's amassing army.


Risen from the Library of Souls and more powerful than ever, Caul and his apocalyptic agenda seem unstoppable. Only one hope remains-deliver Noor to the meeting place of the seven prophesied ones. If they can decipher its secret location.

The Undocumented Americans,"The Undocumented Americans


NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST • One of the first undocumented immigrants to graduate from Harvard reveals the hidden lives of her fellow undocumented Americans in this deeply personal and groundbreaking portrait of a nation.


“Karla’s book sheds light on people’s personal experiences and allows their stories to be told and their voices to be heard.”—Selena Gomez


LOS ANGELES TIMES
 BOOK PRIZE FINALIST • LONGLISTED FOR THE PORCHLIGHT BUSINESS BOOK AWARD • 
NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY 
VULTURE 
AND ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY 
The New York Times Book Book Review

Book Riot • Library Journal


Writer Karla Cornejo Villavicencio was on DACA when she decided to write about being undocumented for the first time using her own name. It was right after the election of 2016, the day she realized the story she’d tried to steer clear of was the only one she wanted to tell.  So she wrote her immigration lawyer’s phone number on her hand in Sharpie and embarked on a trip across the country to tell the stories of her fellow undocumented immigrants—and to find the hidden key to her own. 


Looking beyond the flashpoints of the border or the activism of the DREAMers, Cornejo Villavicencio explores the lives of the undocumented—and the mysteries of her own life. She finds the singular, effervescent characters across the nation often reduced in the media to political pawns or nameless laborers. The stories she tells are not deferential or naively inspirational but show the love, magic, heartbreak, insanity, and vulgarity that infuse the day-to-day lives of her subjects. 


In New York, we meet the undocumented workers who were recruited into the federally funded Ground Zero cleanup after 9/11. In Miami, we enter the ubiquitous botanicas, which offer medicinal herbs and potions to those whose status blocks them from any other healthcare options. In Flint, Michigan, we learn of demands for state ID in order to receive life-saving clean water. In Connecticut, Cornejo Villavicencio, childless by choice, finds family in two teenage girls whose father is in sanctuary. And through it all we see the author grappling with the biggest questions of love, duty, family, and survival. 


In her incandescent, relentlessly probing voice, Karla Cornejo Villavicencio combines sensitive reporting and powerful personal narratives to bring to light remarkable stories of resilience, madness, and death. Through these stories we come to understand what it truly means to be a stray. An expendable. A hero. An American.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/8/8/8809005786252-2.jpg,Karla Cornejo Villavicencio,Penguin Books,2020,208,Tiếng Anh,Biography: General,https://www.fahasa.com/the-undocumented-americans.html

He is the darkest star.

Less than a year ago, Evelyn Dasher was a normal girl, living a safe, rather unremarkable life―a life that was a total lie. Now she’s learned the truth about who she was and what she is.


Hidden within Zone 3, she knows that if she loses control of her dangerous abilities again, she not only puts everyone in the secret community at risk, but also the beautiful, deadly inhuman Luc. He will do anything to keep her safe. Lie. Barter. Beg. Kill.


But there are truths that not even Luc can prepare for, and as Evie’s abilities evolve, the consequences of everything he’s done turn devastating.

From the 
New York Times
 bestselling author of 
Star Wars: Resistance Reborn 
comes the first book in the Between Earth and Sky trilogy, inspired by the civilizations of the Pre-Columbian Americas and woven into a tale of celestial prophecies, political intrigue, and forbidden magic.


A god will return


When the earth and sky converge


Under the black sun


In the holy city of Tova, the winter solstice is usually a time for celebration and renewal, but this year it coincides with a solar eclipse, a rare celestial event proscribed by the Sun Priest as an unbalancing of the world.


Meanwhile, a ship launches from a distant city bound for Tova and set to arrive on the solstice. The captain of the ship, Xiala, is a disgraced Teek whose song can calm the waters around her as easily as it can warp a man’s mind. Her ship carries one passenger. Described as harmless, the passenger, Serapio, is a young man, blind, scarred, and cloaked in destiny. As Xiala well knows, when a man is described as harmless, he usually ends up being a villain.

Eleanor,"Eleanor


New York Times
 Bestseller


Prizewinning bestselling author David Michaelis presents a “stunning” (
The Wall Street Journal
) breakthrough portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, America’s longest-serving First Lady, an avatar of democracy whose ever-expanding agency as diplomat, activist, and humanitarian made her one of the world’s most widely admired and influential women.


In the first single-volume cradle-to-grave portrait in six decades, acclaimed biographer David Michaelis delivers a stunning account of Eleanor Roosevelt’s remarkable life of transformation. An orphaned niece of President Theodore Roosevelt, she converted her Gilded Age childhood of denial and secrecy into an irreconcilable marriage with her ambitious fifth cousin Franklin. Despite their inability to make each other happy, Franklin Roosevelt transformed Eleanor from a settlement house volunteer on New York’s Lower East Side into a matching partner in New York’s most important power couple in a generation.


When Eleanor discovered Franklin’s betrayal with her younger, prettier social secretary, Lucy Mercer, she offered a divorce and vowed to face herself honestly. Here is an Eleanor both more vulnerable and more aggressive, more psychologically aware and sexually adaptable than we knew. She came to accept FDR’s bond with his executive assistant, Missy LeHand; she allowed her children to live their own lives, as she never could; and she explored her sexual attraction to women, among them a star female reporter on FDR’s first presidential campaign, and younger men.


Eleanor needed emotional connection. She pursued deeper relationships wherever she could find them. Throughout her life and travels, there was always another person or place she wanted to heal. As FDR struggled to recover from polio, Eleanor became a voice for the voiceless, her husband’s proxy in presidential ambition, and then the people’s proxy in the White House. Later, she would be the architect of international human rights and world citizen of the Atomic Age, urging Americans to cope with the anxiety of global annihilation by cultivating a “world mind.” She insisted that we cannot live for ourselves alone but must learn to live together or we will die together.


Drawing on new research, Michaelis’s riveting portrait is not just a comprehensive biography of a major American figure, but the story of an American ideal: how our freedom is always a choice. 
Eleanor

Is This Anything?,"Is This Anything?


The first book in twenty-five years from Jerry Seinfeld features his best work across five decades in comedy.


Since his first performance at the legendary New York nightclub “Catch a Rising Star” as a twenty-one-year-old college student in fall of 1975, Jerry Seinfeld has written his own material and saved everything. “Whenever I came up with a funny bit, whether it happened on a stage, in a conversation, or working it out on my preferred canvas, the big yellow legal pad, I kept it in one of those old school accordion folders,” Seinfeld writes. “So I have everything I thought was worth saving from forty-five years of hacking away at this for all I was worth.”


For this book, Jerry Seinfeld has selected his favorite material, organized decade by decade. In page after hilarious page, one brilliantly crafted observation after another, readers will witness the evolution of one of the great comedians of our time and gain new insights into the thrilling but unforgiving art of writing stand-up comedy.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_235381.jpg,Jerry Seinfeld,Simon And Schuster,2020,480,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Arts & Entertainment,https://www.fahasa.com/is-this-anything.html
The Upswing: How America Came Together A Century Ago And How We Can Do It Again,"The Upswing: How America Came Together A Century Ago And How We Can Do It Again


From the author of 
Bowling Alone
 and
 Our Kids,
 a “sweeping yet remarkably accessible” (
The Wall Street Journal
) analysis that “offers superb, often counterintuitive insights” (
The New York Times
) to demonstrate how we have gone from an individualistic “I” society to a more communitarian “We” society and then back again, and how we can learn from that experience to become a stronger, more unified nation.


Deep and accelerating inequality; unprecedented political polarization; vitriolic public discourse; a fraying social fabric; public and private narcissism—Americans today seem to agree on only one thing: This is the worst of times.


But we’ve been here before. During the Gilded Age of the late 1800s, America was highly individualistic, starkly unequal, fiercely polarized, and deeply fragmented, just as it is today. However as the twentieth century opened, America became—slowly, unevenly, but steadily—more egalitarian, more cooperative, more generous; a society on the upswing, more focused on our responsibilities to one another and less focused on our narrower self-interest. Sometime during the 1960s, however, these trends reversed, leaving us in today’s disarray.


In a sweeping overview of more than a century of history, drawing on his inimitable combination of statistical analysis and storytelling, Robert Putnam analyzes a remarkable confluence of trends that brought us from an “I” society to a “We” society and then back again. He draws inspiring lessons for our time from an earlier era, when a dedicated group of reformers righted the ship, putting us on a path to becoming a society once again based on community. Engaging, revelatory, and timely, this is Putnam’s most ambitious work yet, a fitting capstone to a brilliant career.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_235376.jpg,"Robert D.

"Joe Biden: The Life, The Run, And What Matters Now","Joe Biden: The Life, The Run, And What Matters Now


A 
FINANCIAL TIMES 
BEST BOOK OF 2020


A concise, brilliant, and trenchant examination of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s successful lifelong quest for the presidency by National Book Award winner Evan Osnos.


President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been called both the luckiest man and the unluckiest—fortunate to have sustained a fifty-year political career that reached the White House, but also marked by deep personal losses and disappointments that he has suffered.


Yet even as Biden’s life has been shaped by drama, it has also been powered by a willingness, rare at the top ranks of politics, to confront his shortcomings, errors, and reversals of fortune. As he says, “Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.” His trials have forged in him a deep empathy for others in hardship—an essential quality as he leads America toward recovery and renewal.


Blending up-close journalism and broader context, Evan Osnos, who won the National Book Award in 2014, draws on nearly a decade of reporting for 
The New Yorker
 to capture the characters and meaning of 2020’s extraordinary presidential election. It is based on lengthy interviews with Biden and on revealing conversations with more than a hundred others, including President Barack Obama, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, and a range of activists, advisers, opponents, and Biden family members.


This portrayal illuminates Biden’s long and eventful career in the Senate, his eight years as Obama’s vice president, his sojourn in the political wilderness after being passed over for Hillary Clinton in 2016, his decision to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency, and his choice of Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate.


Osnos ponders the difficulties Biden faces as his presidency begins and weighs how a changing country, a deep well of experiences, and a rigorous approach to the issues, have altered his positions. In this nuanced portrait, Biden emerges as flawed, yet resolute, and tempered by the flame of tragedy—a man who just may be uncannily suited for his moment in history.

Longtime 
Jeopardy!
 host and television icon Alex Trebek reflects on his life and career.


Since debuting as the host of 
Jeopardy!
 in 1984, Alex Trebek has been something like a family member to millions of television viewers, bringing entertainment and education into their homes five nights a week. Last year, he made the stunning announcement that he had been diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. What followed was an incredible outpouring of love and kindness. Social media was flooded with messages of support, and the 
Jeopardy!
 studio received boxes of cards and letters offering guidance, encouragement, and prayers.


For over three decades, Trebek had resisted countless appeals to write a book about his life. Yet he was moved so much by all the goodwill, he felt compelled to finally share his story. “I want people to know a little more about the person they have been cheering on for the past year,” he writes in 
The Answer Is…: Reflections on My Life.


The book combines illuminating personal anecdotes with Trebek’s thoughts on a range of topics, including marriage, parenthood, education, success, spirituality, and philanthropy. Trebek also addresses the questions he gets asked most often by 
Jeopardy! 
fans
,
 such as what prompted him to shave his signature mustache, his insights on legendary players like Ken Jennings and James Holzhauer, and his opinion of Will Ferrell’s 
Saturday Night Live
 impersonation. The book uses a novel structure inspired by 
Jeopardy!
, with each chapter title in the form of a question, and features dozens of never-before-seen photos that candidly capture Trebek over the years.


This wise, charming, and inspiring book is further evidence why Trebek has long been considered one of the most beloved and respected figures in entertainment.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_235374.jpg,Alex Trebek,Simon And Schuster,2020,304,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Arts & Entertainment,https://www.fahasa.com/the-answer-is-reflections-on-my-life.html

How To Avoid A Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have And The Breakthroughs We Need,"How To Avoid A Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have And The Breakthroughs We Need


#1 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER • In this urgent, authoritative book, Bill Gates sets out a wide-ranging, practical—and 
accessible—
plan for how the world can get to zero greenhouse gas emissions in time to avoid a climate catastrophe.


Bill Gates has spent a decade investigating the causes and effects of climate change. With the help of experts in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, and finance, he has focused on what must be done in order to stop the planet's slide to certain environmental disaster. In this book, he not only explains why we need to work toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, but also details what we need to do to achieve this profoundly important goal.


He gives us a clear-eyed description of the challenges we face. Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions—suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise.


As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_235215.jpg,Bill Gates,Random House,2021,288,Tiếng Anh,"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology",https://www.fahasa.com/how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster-the-solutions-we-have-and-the-breakthroughs-we-need.html

“As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theater, flashlight cast down in the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power—which groups have it and which do not.”


In this brilliant book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.


Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people’s lives and behavior and the nation’s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people—including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball’s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others—she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.

From Vice President Kamala Harris, one of America's most inspiring political leaders, a book about the core truths that unite us, and the long struggle to discern what those truths are and how best to act upon them, in her own life and across the life of our country


""A life story that genuinely entrances."" —
Los Angeles Times 


Vice President Kamala Harris's commitment to speaking truth is informed by her upbringing. The daughter of immigrants, she was raised in an Oakland, California community that cared deeply about social justice; her parents--an esteemed economist from Jamaica and an admired cancer researcher from India--met as activists in the civil rights movement when they were graduate students at Berkeley. Growing up, Harris herself never hid her passion for justice, and when she became a prosecutor out of law school, a deputy district attorney, she quickly established herself as one of the most innovative change agents in American law enforcement. She progressed rapidly to become the elected District Attorney for San Francisco, and then the chief law enforcement officer of the state of California as a whole. Known for bringing a voice to the voiceless, she took on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis, winning a historic settlement for California's working families. Her hallmarks were applying a holistic, data-driven approach to many of California's thorniest issues, always eschewing stale ""tough on crime"" rhetoric as presenting a series of false choices. Neither ""tough"" nor ""soft"" but 
smart
 on crime became her mantra. Being smart means learning the truths that can make us better as a community, and supporting those truths with all our might. That has been the pole star that guided Harris to a transformational career as the top law enforcement official in California, and it is guiding her now as a transformational United States Senator, grappling with an array of complex issues that affect her state, our country, and the world, from health care and the new economy to immigration, national security, the opioid crisis, and accelerating inequality.


By reckoning with the big challenges we face together, drawing on the hard-won wisdom and insight from her own career and the work of those who have most inspired her, Kamala Harris offers in THE TRUTHS WE HOLD a master class in problem solving, in crisis management, and leadership in challenging times. Through the arc of her own life, on into the great work of our day, she communicates a vision of shared struggle, shared purpose, and shared values. In a book rich in many home truths, not least is that a relatively small number of people work very hard to convince a great many of us that we have less in common than we actually do, but it falls to us to look past them and get on with the good work of living our common truth. When we do, our shared effort will continue to sustain us and this great nation, now and in the years to come.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_235208.jpg,Kamala Harris,Penguin Books,2020,336,Tiếng Anh,"Biography: Historical, Political & Military",https://www.fahasa.com/the-truths-we-hold-an-american-journey-365568.html

The Bluest Eye.”
 —Kiley Reid, 
Wall Street Journal
 


“

– Entertainment Weekly


From 
The
 
New York Times
-bestselling author of 
The Mothers
, a stunning new novel about twin sisters, inseparable as children, who ultimately choose to live in two very different worlds, one black and one white.


The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect?


Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing
. 
Looking well beyond issues of race,

Under The Black Hat: My Life In The WWE And Beyond,"Under The Black Hat: My Life In The WWE And Beyond


From legendary wrestling announcer Jim Ross comes a candid, colorful memoir about the inner workings of the WWE and the personal crises he weathered at the height of his career.


If you’ve caught a televised wrestling match anytime in the past THIRTY years, you’ve probably heard Jim Ross’s throaty Oklahoma twang. The beloved longtime announcer of WWE is already an icon to generations of wrestling fans, and he’s not slowing down, having just signed on as the announcer of the starry new wrestling venture All Elite Wrestling. In this follow-up to his bestselling memoir 
Slobberknocker
, he dishes about not only his long career, which includes nurturing global stars like Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and John Cena, but also about the challenges of aging and disability, his split from collaborator Vince McMahon, and the sudden death of his beloved wife, Jan. The result is a gruff, endearing, and remarkably human-scale portrait, set against the larger-than-life backdrop of professional wrestling.


Ross’s ascent in WWE mirrors the rise of professional wrestling itself from a DIY sideshow to a billion-dollar business. 
Under the Black Hat 
traces all the highs and lows of that wild ride, in which Jim served not only as on-air commentator, but talent manager, payroll master, and even occasional in-ring foil to threats like Paul “Triple H” Levesque and Undertaker. While his role brought him riches and exposure Jim never dreamed of growing up in a small town in Oklahoma, he chafed against the strictures of a fickle corporate culture and what he saw as a narrow vision of what makes great wrestlers—and great story lines. When suddenly stricken with Bell’s palsy, a form of facial paralysis that makes it impossible to smile, he stared down his greatest fear—being cast out of the announcing booth for good.


Picking up where 
Slobberknocker 
left off and ending on the cusp of a new career in a reimagined industry, 
Under the Black Hat 
is the triumphant tale of a country boy who made it to the top, took a few knocks, and stuck around—just where his fans like him.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_235073.jpg,"Jim Ross, Paul O'Brien",Simon And Schuster,2020,320,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Arts & Entertainment,https://www.fahasa.com/under-the-black-hat-my-life-in-the-wwe-and-beyond.html

When Stephanie’s beloved Grandma Mazur's new husband died on their wedding night, the only thing he left her was a beat-up old easy chair…and the keys to a life-changing fortune.


But as Stephanie and Grandma Mazur search for Jimmy Rosolli’s treasure, they discover that they’re not the only ones on the hunt. Two dangerous enemies from the past stand in their way—along with a new adversary who’s even more formidable: Gabriela Rose, a dark-eyed beauty from Little Havana with a taste for designer clothes. She’s also a soldier of fortune, a gourmet cook, an expert in firearms and mixed martial arts—and someone who’s about to give Stephanie a real run for her money.


Stephanie may be in over her head, but she’s got two things that Gabriela doesn’t: an unbreakable bond with her family and a stubborn streak that will never let her quit.


She’ll need both to survive because this search for “fortune and glory” will turn into a desperate race against time with more on the line than ever before. Because even as she searches for the treasure and fights to protect her Grandma Mazur, her own deepest feelings will be tested—as Stephanie could finally be forced to choose between Joe Morelli and Ranger.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_235070.jpg,Janet Evanovich,Simon And Schuster,2020,320,Tiếng Anh,Thrillers,https://www.fahasa.com/fortune-and-glory.html

Galaxy “Alex” Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale’s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug-dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. In fact, by age twenty, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she’s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most prestigious universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her?


Still searching for answers, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. Their eight windowless “tombs” are the well-known haunts of the rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street’s biggest players. But their occult activities are more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive. They tamper with forbidden magic. They raise the dead. And, sometimes, they prey on the living.

All the Devils Are Here
, the 16th novel by #1 bestselling author Louise Penny finds Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Quebec investigating a sinister plot in the City of Light


On their first night in Paris, the Gamaches gather as a family for a bistro dinner with Armand’s godfather, the billionaire Stephen Horowitz. Walking home together after the meal, they watch in horror as Stephen is knocked down and critically injured in what Gamache knows is no accident, but a deliberate attempt on the elderly man’s life.


When a strange key is found in Stephen’s possession it sends Armand, his wife Reine-Marie, and his former second-in-command at the Sûreté, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, from the top of the Tour d’Eiffel, to the bowels of the Paris Archives, from luxury hotels to odd, coded, works of art.


It sends them deep into the secrets Armand’s godfather has kept for decades.


A gruesome discovery in Stephen’s Paris apartment makes it clear the secrets are more rancid, the danger far greater and more imminent, than they realized.


Soon the whole family is caught up in a web of lies and deceit. In order to find the truth, Gamache will have to decide whether he can trust his friends, his colleagues, his instincts, his own past. His own family.

The Whisper Man


You knew a teenager like Charlie Crabtree. A dark imagination, a sinister smile--always on the outside of the group. Some part of you suspected he might be capable of doing something awful. Twenty-five years ago, Crabtree did just that, committing a murder so shocking that it's attracted that strange kind of infamy that only exists on the darkest corners of the internet--and inspired more than one copycat.


Paul Adams remembers the case all too well: Crabtree--and his victim--were Paul's friends. Paul has slowly put his life back together. But now his mother, old and suffering from dementia, has taken a turn for the worse. Though every inch of him resists, it is time to come home.


It's not long before things start to go wrong. Paul learns that Detective Amanda Beck is investigating another copycat that has struck in the nearby town of Featherbank. His mother is distressed, insistent that there's something in the house. And someone is following him. Which reminds him of the most unsettling thing about that awful day twenty-five years ago.


It wasn't just the murder.

"High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, And Impeachment Of Donald Trump","High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, And Impeachment Of Donald Trump


Two award-winning journalists offer the most comprehensive inside story behind our most significant modern political drama: the House impeachment of Donald Trump.


Having spent a year essentially embedded inside several House committees, Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner draw on many sources, including key House leaders, to expose the politicking, playcalling, and strategies debated backstage and to explain the Democrats' successes and apparent public failures during the show itself.


High Crimes
 opens with Nancy Pelosi deciding the House should take up impeachment, then, in part one, leaps back to explain what Ukraine was really all about: not just Joe Biden and election interference, but a money grab and oil. In the second part, the authors recount key meetings throughout the run up to the impeachment hearings, including many of the heated confrontations between the Trump administration and House Democrats. And the third part takes readers behind the scenes of those hearings, showing why certain things happened the way they did for reasons that never came up in public.


In the end, having illuminated every step of impeachment, from the schemes that led Giuliani to the Ukraine in 2016 to Fiona Hill's rebuking the Republicans' conspiracy theories,

Csorwe does―she will climb the mountain, enter the Shrine of the Unspoken, and gain the most honored title: sacrifice.


But on the day of her foretold death, a powerful mage offers her a new fate. Leave with him, and live. Turn away from her destiny and her god to become a thief, a spy, an assassin―the wizard's loyal sword. Topple an empire, and help him reclaim his seat of power.


But Csorwe will soon learn―gods remember, and if you live long enough, all debts come due.

In 2001, when Jacqueline Novogratz founded Acumen, a global community of socially and environmentally responsible partners dedicated to changing the way the world tackles poverty, few had heard of impact investing Acumen's practice of ""doing well by doing good."" Nineteen years later, there's been a seismic shift in how corporate boards and other stakeholders evaluate businesses. Still, it isn't easy to reach a success that includes profits as well as mutually favorable relationships with workers and the communities in which they live. So how can today's leaders, who often kick off their enterprises with high hopes and short timetables, navigate the challenges of poverty and war, of egos and impatience, which have stymied generations of investors who came before? Drawing on inspiring stories from change-makers around the world and on memories of her own most difficult experiences, Jacqueline divulges the most common leadership mistakes and the mind-sets needed to rise above them. The culmination of thirty years of work developing sustainable solutions for the problems of the poor, Manifesto for a Moral Revolution offers the perspectives necessary for all those - whether ascending the corporate ladder or bringing solar light to rural villages - who seek to leave this world better off than they found it.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234986.jpg,Jacqueline Novogratz,Macmillan US,2020,272,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/manifesto-for-a-moral-revolution-practices-to-build-a-better-world.html
Unfollow: A Memoir Of Loving And Leaving Extremism,"Unfollow: A Memoir Of Loving And Leaving Extremism


The activist and TED speaker Megan Phelps-Roper reveals her life growing up in the most hated family in America


At the age of five, Megan Phelps-Roper began protesting homosexuality and other alleged vices alongside fellow members of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas. Founded by her grandfather and consisting almost entirely of her extended family, the tiny group would gain worldwide notoriety for its pickets at military funerals and celebrations of death and tragedy. As Phelps-Roper grew up, she saw that church members were close companions and accomplished debaters, applying the logic of predestination and the language of the King James Bible to everyday life with aplomb--which, as the church's Twitter spokeswoman, she learned to do with great skill. Soon, however, dialogue on Twitter caused her to begin doubting the church's leaders and message: If humans were sinful and fallible, how could the church itself be so confident about its beliefs? As she digitally jousted with critics, she started to wonder if sometimes they had a point--and then she began exchanging messages with a man who would help change her life.


A gripping memoir of escaping extremism and falling in love, 
Unfollow
 relates Phelps-Roper's moral awakening, her departure from the church, and how she exchanged the absolutes she grew up with for new forms of warmth and community.

Troubled Water: What's Wrong With What We Drink,"Troubled Water: What's Wrong With What We Drink


New York Times 
bestselling author Seth M. Siegel shows how our drinking water got contaminated, what it may be doing to us, and what we must do to make it safe.


If you thought America's drinking water problems started and ended in Flint, Michigan, think again. From big cities and suburbs to the rural heartland, chemicals linked to cancer, heart disease, obesity, birth defects, and lowered IQ routinely spill from our taps.


Many are to blame: the EPA, Congress, a bipartisan coalition of powerful governors and mayors, chemical companies, and drinking water utilities--even NASA and the Pentagon. Meanwhile, the bottled water industry has been fanning our fears about tap water, but bottled water is often no safer.


The tragedy is that existing technologies could launch a new age of clean, healthy, and safe tap water for only a few dollars a week per person.


Scrupulously researched, 
Troubled Water
 is full of shocking stories about contaminated water found throughout the country and about the everyday heroes who have successfully forced changes in the quality and safety of our drinking water. And it concludes with what America must do to reverse decades of neglect and play-it-safe inaction by government at all levels in order to keep our most precious resource safe.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234981.jpg,Seth M.

Masha Maximow has made some bad choices in life - choices that hurt people. But she's also made some pretty decent ones. In the log file of life, however, she can't quite work out which side of the ledger she currently stands.


Masha works for Xoth Intelligence, an InfoSec company upgrading the Slovstakian Interior Ministry's ability to spy on its citizens' telecommunications with state-of-the-art software (at least, as state-of-the-art as Xoth is prepared to offer in its middle-upper pricing tier).

Toil & Trouble: A Memoir,"Toil & Trouble: A Memoir


From the number one 
New York Times
 bestselling author comes another stunning memoir that is tender, touching...and just a little spooky.


""Here’s a partial list of things I don’t believe in: God. The Devil. Heaven. Hell. Bigfoot. Ancient Aliens. Past lives. Life after death. Vampires. Zombies. Reiki. Homeopathy. Rolfing. Reflexology. Note that 'witches' and 'witchcraft' are absent from this list. The thing is, I wouldn’t believe in them, and I would privately ridicule any idiot who did, except for one thing: I 
am
 a witch.""


For as long as Augusten Burroughs could remember, he knew things he shouldn't have known. He manifested things that shouldn't have come to pass. And he told exactly no one about this, save one person: his mother. His mother reassured him that it was all perfectly normal, that he was descended from a long line of witches, going back to the days of the early American colonies. And that this family tree was filled with witches. It was a bond that he and his mother shared--until the day she left him in the care of her psychiatrist to be raised in his family (but that's a whole other story). After that, Augusten was on his own. On his own to navigate the world of this tricky power; on his own to either use or misuse this gift.


From the hilarious to the terrifying, 
Toil & Trouble
 is a chronicle of one man's journey to understand himself, to reconcile the powers he can wield with things with which he is helpless. There are very few things that are coincidences, as you will learn in 
Toil & Trouble.

‘If you cannot speak truth at a beheading, when can you speak it?’


England, May 1536. Anne Boleyn is dead, decapitated in the space of a heartbeat by a hired French executioner. As her remains are bundled into oblivion, Thomas Cromwell breakfasts with the victors. The blacksmith’s son from Putney emerges from the spring’s bloodbath to continue his climb to power and wealth, while his formidable master, Henry VIII, settles to short-lived happiness with his third queen, Jane Seymour.


Cromwell is a man with only his wits to rely on; he has no great family to back him, no private army. Despite rebellion at home, traitors plotting abroad and the threat of invasion testing Henry’s regime to breaking point, Cromwell’s robust imagination sees a new country in the mirror of the future. But can a nation, or a person, shed the past like a skin? Do the dead continually unbury themselves? What will you do, the Spanish ambassador asks Cromwell, when the king turns on you, as sooner or later he turns on everyone close to him?

She traces the final years of Thomas Cromwell, the boy from nowhere who climbs to the heights of power, offering a defining portrait of predator and prey, of a ferocious contest between present and past, between royal will and a common man’s vision: of a modern nation making itself through conflict, passion and courage.

Everything Is Spiritual,"Everything Is Spiritual


I've had a sense since I was young that there's more going on here, that the world is not a cold, dead place, that it's alive in some compelling and mysterious way.


This book is about that sense. I've tried to listen to it, and follow it, and trust it. It's been devastating at times, intoxicating at others, heartbreaking and maddening and euphoric--how do you make sense of this experience we're having here on this ball of rock hurtling through space at 67,000 miles an hour?


There are big questions: Everything is made of particles and atoms, and the universe has been expanding for thirteen billion years?


And then there are those other questions, about the people and places and events that have shaped us.


HOWEVER MASSIVE AND COSMIC IT ALL IS, IT'S ALSO REALLY, REALLY PERSONAL AND SPIRITUAL. THAT'S THE WORD FOR IT.


That's the sense I've been following for a while now--this awareness that there's something bigger happening in the depth and complexity and struggle of life, something that connects us all, reminding us that it all matters and it's all headed somewhere.

'A blistering plot and crisp writing make The Night Swim an unputdownable read.' 
Sarah Pekkanen author of 
The Wife Between Us


In 
The Night Swim
, a new thriller from Megan Goldin, author of the gripping and unforgettable (Harlen Coben)
The Escape Room
,a true-crime podcast host covering a controversial trial finds herself drawn deep into a small town's dark past and a brutal crime that took place there years before.


Ever since her true-crime podcast became an overnight sensation and set an innocent man free, Rachel Krall has become a household name - and the last hope for people seeking justice. But she's used to being recognised for her voice, not her face. Which makes it all the more unsettling when she finds a note on her car windshield, addressed to her, begging for help.


The new season of Rachel's podcast has brought her to a small town being torn apart by a devastating rape trial. A local golden boy, a swimmer destined for Olympic greatness, has been accused of raping the beloved granddaughter of the police chief. Under pressure to make Season 3 a success, Rachel throws herself into her investigation - but the mysterious letters keep coming. Someone is following her, and she won't stop until Rachel finds out what happened to her sister twenty-five years ago. Officially, Jenny Stills tragically drowned, but the letters insist she was murdered - and when Rachel starts asking questions, nobody in town wants to answer. The past and present start to collide as Rachel uncovers startling connections between the two cases - and a revelation that will change the course of the trial and the lives of everyone involved.


Electrifying and propulsive,
The Night Swim

A family ranch in Big Su

Hideaway
.


Caitlyn Sullivan had come from a long line of Hollywood royalty, stretching back to her Irish immigrant great-grandfather. At nine, she was already a star―yet still an innocent child who loved to play hide and seek with her cousins at the family home in Big Sur. It was during one of those games that she disappeared.


Some may have considered her a pampered princess, but Cate was in fact a smart, scrappy fighter, and she managed to escape her abductors. Dillon Cooper was shocked to find the bloodied, exhausted girl huddled in his house―but when the teenager and his family heard her story they provided refuge, reuniting her with her loved ones.


Cate’s ordeal, though, was far from over. First came the discovery of a shocking betrayal that would send someone she’d trusted to prison. Then there were years spent away in western Ireland, peaceful and protected but with restlessness growing in her soul.


Finally, she would return to Los Angeles, gathering the courage to act again and get past the trauma that had derailed her life. What she didn’t yet know was that two seeds had been planted that long-ago night―one of a great love, and one of a terrible vengeance…",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234661.jpg,Nora Roberts,Macmillan US,2020,454,Tiếng Anh,Contemporary Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/hideaway.html

Conley Hawkins left her family’s small town newspaper,

A charming and memorable debut, which reminds us of the universal language of literature and the power of books to unite and heal."" -Pam Jenoff, New York Times bestselling author of The Lost Girls of Paris


Just after the Second World War, in the small English village of Chawton, an unusual but like-minded group of people band together to attempt something remarkable.


One hundred and fifty years ago, Chawton was the final home of Jane Austen, one of England's finest novelists. Now it's home to a few distant relatives and their diminishing estate. With the last bit of Austen's legacy threatened, a group of disparate individuals come together to preserve both Jane Austen's home and her legacy. These people-a laborer, a young widow, the local doctor, and a movie star, among others-could not be more different and yet they are united in their love for the works and words of Austen. As each of them endures their own quiet struggle with loss and trauma, some from the recent war, others from more distant tragedies, they rally together to create the Jane Austen Society.

One Step Ahead,"One Step Ahead


There's been a revolution in negotiating tactics.


The world's best negotiators have moved beyond How to Win Friends & Influence People and Getting to Yes. For over twenty years. David Sally has been teaching the art of negotiation at leading business schools and to executives at top companies. Now, he delivers the proven, clear, actionable insights you need to stay competitive in an ever-changing marketplace.


One Step Ahead offers the fundamental wisdom that elevates the sophisticated negotiator above everyone else. Readers will gain the advantage in everything from determining when to negotiate and deciphering a game strategically, to understanding which personality traits matter, why emotions are not necessarily to be avoided, and how to be tough and fair. You'll learn to be round on the outside and square on the inside, how to command the idiom, why to avoid bumping into the furniture, and how to achieve mastery of the word and the number. While all of life is not a negotiation, Sally says, a negotiation incorporates all of life-One Step Ahead is for anyone and everyone who bargains, parents, manages, buys, sells, emotes, and engages.


Based on cutting-edge studies and real-world results, and drawing parallels to everything from the NBA to the corner con game to Machiavelli, Xi Jinping, and Barack Obama, One Step Ahead upends conventional wisdom to make sure that you have what it takes to stay one step ahead-no matter whom you are facing across the table.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234657.jpg,David Sally,Macmillan US,2020,384,Tiếng Anh,Business Negotiation,https://www.fahasa.com/one-step-ahead.html

North Carolina, 2018:

Morgan Christopher's life has been derailed. Taking the fall for a crime she did not commit, her dream of a career in art is put on hold―until a mysterious visitor makes her an offer that will get her released from prison immediately. Her assignment: restore an old post office mural in a sleepy southern town. Morgan knows nothing about art restoration, but desperate to be free, she accepts. What she finds under the layers of grime is a painting that tells the story of madness, violence, and a conspiracy of small town secrets.


North Carolina, 1940:

Anna Dale, an artist from New Jersey, wins a national contest to paint a mural for the post office in Edenton, North Carolina. Alone in the world and in great need of work, she accepts. But what she doesn't expect is to find herself immersed in a town where prejudices run deep, where people are hiding secrets behind closed doors, and where the price of being different might just end in murder.


What happened to Anna Dale? Are the clues hidden in the decrepit mural? Can Morgan overcome her own demons to discover what exists beneath the layers of lies?

A 
New York Times
 Bestseller


For Lady Gaga, kindness is the driving force behind everything she says and does.


The quiet power of kindness can change the way we view one another, our communities, and even ourselves. She embodies this mission, and through her work, brings more kindness into our world every single day.


Lady Gaga has always believed in the importance of being yourself, being kind to yourself, and being kind to others, no matter who they are or where they come from. With that sentiment in mind, she and her mother, Cynthia Germanotta, founded Born This Way Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to making the world a kinder and braver place. Through the years, they've collected stories of kindness, bravery and resilience from young people all over the world, proving that kindness truly is the universal language. And now, we invite you to read these stories and follow along as each and every young author finds their voice just as Lady Gaga has found hers.


Within these pages, you’ll meet young changemakers who found their inner strength, who prevailed in the face of bullies, who started their own social movements, who decided to break through the mental health stigma and share how they felt, who created safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth, and who have embraced kindness with every fiber of their being by helping others without the expectation of anything in return.


In one story, you’ll read about a young person with an autoimmune disease, who after being bullied at school, learned how to practice self-love and started an organization with the mission of educating others about the importance of self-love, too; and in another story, you’ll meet a young person who decided to start a movement to help eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health and encouraged others to talk about their feelings openly and honestly, a reminder that kindness and mental wellness go hand in hand.


Not only were we moved by these individual acts of kindness, but we were also touched by the many stories of organizations, neighborhoods, and entire communities that fully dedicated themselves to helping those in need and found new, innovative ways to make our world a kinder and braver place.


Individually and collectively, these stories prove that kindness not only saves lives but builds community. Kindness is inclusion, it is pride, it is empathy, it is compassion, it is self-respect and it is the guiding light to love. Kindness is always transformational, and its never-ending ripples result in even more kind acts that can change our lives, our communities, and our world.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234109.jpg,Lady Gaga,Macmillan US,2020,304,Tiếng Anh,"Assertiveness, Motivation & Self-esteem",https://www.fahasa.com/channel-kindness-stories-of-kindness-and-community-364133.html

A husband, a father, a son, a business owner...And the best getaway driver east of the Mississippi.


Beauregard “Bug” Montage is an honest mechanic, a loving husband, and a hard-working dad. Bug knows there’s no future in the man he used to be: known from the hills of North Carolina to the beaches of Florida as the best wheelman on the East Coast.


He thought he'd left all that behind him, but as his carefully built new life begins to crumble, he finds himself drawn inexorably back into a world of blood and bullets. When a smooth-talking former associate comes calling with a can't-miss jewelry store heist, Bug feels he has no choice but to get back in the driver's seat. And Bug is at his best where the scent of gasoline mixes with the smell of fear.


Haunted by the ghost of who he used to be and the father who disappeared when he needed him most, Bug must find a way to navigate this blacktop wasteland...or die trying.

 Notable Book of 2020


“[A] sweeping and authoritative history"" 
(
The New York Times Book Review
),
 
Black Wave
 
is an unprecedented and ambitious examination of how the modern Middle East unraveled and why it started with the pivotal year of 1979.


Kim Ghattas seamlessly weaves together history, geopolitics, and culture to deliver a gripping read of the largely unexplored story of the rivalry between between Saudi Arabia and Iran, born from the sparks of the 1979 Iranian revolution and fueled by American policy.


With vivid story-telling, extensive historical research and on-the-ground reporting, Ghattas dispels accepted truths about a region she calls home. She explores how Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran, once allies and twin pillars of US strategy in the region, became mortal enemies after 1979. She shows how they used and distorted religion in a competition that went well beyond geopolitics. Feeding intolerance, suppressing cultural expression, and encouraging sectarian violence from Egypt to Pakistan, the war for cultural supremacy led to Iran’s fatwa against author Salman Rushdie, the assassination of countless intellectuals, the birth of groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, the September 11th terrorist attacks, and the rise of ISIS.


Ghattas introduces us to a riveting cast of characters whose lives were upended by the geopolitical drama over four decades: from the Pakistani television anchor who defied her country’s dictator, to the Egyptian novelist thrown in jail for indecent writings all the way to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.

The Burning Shadow
, the steamy, shocking second installment of the Origin series that will leave readers reeling.


The trade paperback edition of 
The Burning Shadow 
includes the exclusive bonus short scene, 
Like the First Time.


When Evelyn Dasher crossed paths with Luc, she was thrown headfirst into the world of the Lux--only to discover that she was already far more involved in their world than she ever suspected.


Because the Luxen aren't the only ones with a hidden past. There's a gap in Evie's memory, lost months of her life and a lingering sense that something happened, something she can't remember and nobody is willing to tell her. She needs to find out the truth about who she is--and who she was. But every answer she finds only brings up more questions.


Her search for the truth brings her ever closer to Luc, the Origin at the center of it all. He's powerful, arrogant, inhumanly beautiful, extremely dangerous...and possibly in love with her. But even as Evie falls for him, she can't help but wonder if his attraction is to her, or to the memory of a girl who no longer exists.


And all the while, a new threat looms: reports of a flu-like, fatal virus that the government insists is being spread by Luxen.

"This Thing Called Life: Prince's Odyssey, On + Off The Record","This Thing Called Life: Prince's Odyssey, On + Off The Record


A warm and surprisingly real-life biography, featuring never-before-seen photos, of one of rock's greatest talents: Prince.


Neal Karlen was the only journalist Prince granted in-depth press interviews to for over a dozen years, from before 
Purple Rain
 to when the artist changed his name to an unpronounceable glyph. Karlen interviewed Prince for three 
Rolling Stone
 cover stories, wrote ""3 Chains o' Gold,"" Prince's ""rock video opera,"" as well as the star's last testament, which may be buried with Prince's will underneath Prince's vast and private compound, Paisley Park.


According to Prince's former fiancée Susannah Melvoin, Karlen was ""the only reporter who made Prince sound like what he really sounded like."" Karlen quit writing about Prince a quarter-century before the mega-star died, but he never quit Prince, and the two remained friends for the last thirty-one years of the superstar's life.


Well before they met as writer and subject, Prince and Karlen knew each other as two of the gang of kids who biked around Minneapolis's mostly-segregated Northside. (They played basketball at the Dairy Queen next door to Karlen's grandparents, two blocks from the budding musician.) He asserts that Prince can't be understood without first understanding '70s Minneapolis, and that even Prince's best friends knew only 15 percent of him: that was all he was willing and able to give, no matter how much he cared for them.


Going back to Prince Rogers Nelson's roots, especially his contradictory, often tortured, and sometimes violent relationship with his father, 
This Thing Called Life
 profoundly changes what we know about Prince, and explains him as no biography has: a superstar who calls in the middle of the night to talk, who loved 
The Wire 
and could quote from every episode of 
The Office
, who frequented libraries and jammed spontaneously for local crowds (and fed everyone pancakes afterward), who was lonely but craved being alone. Readers will drive around Minneapolis with Prince in a convertible, talk about movies and music and life, and watch as he tries not to curse, instead dishing a healthy dose of ""mamma jammas.""",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234080.jpg,Neal Karlen,Macmillan US,2020,352,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Arts & Entertainment,https://www.fahasa.com/this-thing-called-life-prince-s-odyssey-on-off-the-record.html

A magician linked to three murders and suspicious deaths years ago disappears in the middle of his new act in 
New York Times
 bestseller Phillip Margolin's latest thriller featuring Robin Lockwood, 
A Reasonable Doubt
.


Justice is blind. But how do you solve a crime that no one could see?


Criminal defense attorney and former MMA fighter Robin Lockwood does not believe in magic. Behind every good illusion is a good explanation--unless you consider the work of Robert Chesterfield, that is. One of her firm's former clients, Chesterfield is a career magician who was linked to a series of suspicious deaths. Even though he walked free, Robin can't help but wonder whether he was as innocent as he appeared.


Now, decades later, the mystery surrounding Chesterfield has taken a dark turn. When he stages his greatest-ever trick, called the Chamber of Death, Chesterfield himself turns up dead at the end. With dozens of witnesses--and no one with any idea of how it was orchestrated--Robin finds herself at loose ends as she tries to untangle this twisted case...and learn the truth about Chesterfield, once and for all.


""In the hands of Phillip Margolin, nothing is ever simple and no one is really safe. He is the master of suspense mystery.""--Associated Press

The Shongairi conquered Earth. In mere minutes, half the human race died, and our cities lay in shattered ruins.


But the Shongairi didn’t expect the survivors’ tenacity. And, crucially, they didn’t know that Earth harbored two species of intelligent, tool-using bipeds. One of them was us. The other, long-lived and lethal, was hiding in the mountains of eastern Europe, the subject of fantasy and legend. When they emerged and made alliance with humankind, the invading aliens didn’t stand a chance.


Now Earth is once again ours. Aided by the advanced tech the aliens left behind, we’re rebuilding as fast as we can.


Meanwhile, a select few of our blood-drinking immortals are on their way to the Shongairi homeworld, having commandeered one of the alien starships...the planet-busting kind.

With its richly imagined portrayal of a lost culture, complete with poetry and fables, traditions and customs, and its searing yet sympathetic view of own society as seen through new eyes, 
The Necessary Beggar
 is an compelling examination of humanity and the redemptive power of love, in the spirit of Ursula K. Le Guin's 
The Dispossessed 
and Robert A. Heinlein's 
Stranger in a Strange Land
.


Lémabantunk, the Glorious City, is a place of peace and plenty, of festivals and flowers, bejeweled streets and glittering waterfalls. But it is also a land of severe justice. Darroti, a young merchant, has been accused of an unforgiveable crime – the brutal murder a highborn woman. Now, in keeping with the customs of their world, his entire family must share in his punishment – exile to the unknown world that lies beyond a mysterious gate.


Passing through that gate, and grieving for the life they leave behind, Darroti and his family find themselves in a harsh and hostile land – America just a few years hence, a country under attack in a world torn by hatred and warfare. Unable to explain their origin, they are rapidly remanded to an internment camp in the Nevada desert, along with thousands of other refugees. There they endeavor to make sense of this ill-fated land where strange gods are worshipped, and living things like flowers and insects are not respected.


After Darroti, unable to bear his disgrace, takes his life, the rest of the family escapes to the outside world. There, each tries to cope in their own way. Timbor, the head of the clan, troubled by the restless spirit of his departed son who comes to him in dreams, does his best to preserve the old ways, and avoid conflict with the outsiders. His eldest son Masofo, who calls himself Max, is lured by the worldly temptations of this new world, while his second son, Erolorit, strives to make a decent life for his family.


But it is Timor's granddaughter, Zamatryna, who is the quickest to adjust to this strange new world. It is she who is the first to learn its language, to adopt its customs, to accept this place as her new home. And, as the strain of adapting themselves to this new life begins to tear the family apart, it is Zama, sustained by the extraordinary love of an ordinary young man, who finds a way to heal their grief and give them new hope.

Stylist


At twenty-five years old, Anna Wiener was beginning to tire of her assistant job in New York publishing. There was no room to grow, and the voyeuristic thrill of answering someone else’s phone had worn thin.


Within a year she had moved to Silicon Valley to take up a job at a data analytics startup in San Francisco. Leaving her business casual skirts and shirts in the wardrobe, she began working in company-branded T-shirts. She had a healthy income for the first time in her life. She felt like part of the future.


But a tide was beginning to turn. People were speaking of tech startups as surveillance companies. Out of sixty employees, only eight of her colleagues were women. Casual sexism was rife. Sexual harassment cases were proliferating. And soon, like everyone else, she was addicted to the internet, refreshing the news, refreshing social media, scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. Slowly, she began to realise that her blind faith in ambitious, arrogant young men from America’s soft suburbs wasn’t just her own personal pathology. It had become a global affliction.


Uncanny Valley
 is a coming of age story set against the backdrop of our generation’s very own gold rush. It’s a story about the tension between old and new, between art and tech, between the quest for money and the quest for meaning – about how our world is changing forever.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234032.jpg,Anna Wiener,Macmillan US,2021,288,Tiếng Anh,Memoirs,https://www.fahasa.com/uncanny-valley.html

From FSGO x 
Logic
: a Stanford professor's spirited dismantling of Silicon Valley's intellectual origins


Adrian Daub’s 
What Tech Calls Thinking
 is a lively dismantling of the ideas that form the intellectual bedrock of Silicon Valley. Equally important to Silicon Valley’s world-altering innovation are the language and ideas it uses to explain and justify itself. And often, those fancy new ideas are simply old motifs playing dress-up in a hoodie. From the myth of dropping out to the war cry of “disruption,” Daub locates the Valley’s supposedly original, radical thinking in the ideas of Heidegger and Ayn Rand, the New Age Esalen Foundation in Big Sur, and American traditions from the tent revival to predestination. Written with verve and imagination, 
What Tech Calls Thinking
 is an intellectual refutation of Silicon Valley's ethos, pulling back the curtain on the self-aggrandizing myths the Valley tells about itself.


FSG Originals × 
Logic 
dissects the way technology functions in everyday lives. The titans of Silicon Valley, for all their utopian imaginings, never really had our best interests at heart: recent threats to democracy, truth, privacy, and safety, as a result of tech’s reckless pursuit of progress, have shown as much. We present an alternate story, one that delights in capturing technology in all its contradictions and innovation, across borders and socioeconomic divisions, from history through the future, beyond platitudes and PR hype, and past doom and gloom. Our collaboration features four brief but provocative forays into the tech industry’s many worlds, and aspires to incite fresh conversations about technology focused on nuanced and accessible explorations of the emerging tools that reorganize and redefine life today.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234029.jpg,Adrian Daub,Macmillan US,2020,160,Tiếng Anh,"Media, Information & Communication Industries",https://www.fahasa.com/what-tech-calls-thinking-an-inquiry-into-the-intellectual-bedrock-of-silicon-valley.html

A spellbinding novel of psychological suspense that follows a young archivist’s obsession with her subject’s mysterious death as it threatens to destroy her fragile grasp on sanity.


When the famed photographer Miranda Brand died mysteriously at the height of her career, it sent shock waves through Callinas, California. Decades later, old wounds are reopened when her son Theo hires the ex-journalist Kate Aitken to archive his mother’s work and personal effects.


As Kate sorts through the vast maze of material and contends with the vicious rumors and shocking details of Miranda's private life, she pieces together a portrait of a vibrant artist buckling under the pressures of ambition, motherhood, and marriage. But Kate has secrets of her own, including a growing attraction to the enigmatic Theo, and when she stumbles across Miranda's diary, her curiosity spirals into a dangerous obsession.

""So delicious that it feels illicit . . . Raven Leilani’s first novel reads like summer: sentences like ice that crackle or melt into a languorous drip; plot suddenly, wildly flying forward like a bike down a hill."" ―Jazmine Hughes,

, O: The Oprah Magazine


No one wants what no one wants.

And how do we even know what we want? How do we know we’re ready to take it?


Edie is stumbling her way through her twenties
―
sharing a subpar apartment in Bushwick, clocking in and out of her admin job, making a series of inappropriate sexual choices. She is also haltingly, fitfully giving heat and air to the art that simmers inside her. And then she meets Eric, a digital archivist with a family in New Jersey, including an autopsist wife who has agreed to an open marriage
―
with 
rules
.


As if navigating the constantly shifting landscapes of contemporary sexual manners and racial politics weren’t hard enough, Edie finds herself unemployed and invited into Eric’s home―though not by Eric. She becomes a hesitant ally to his wife and a de facto role model to his adopted daughter. Edie may be the only Black woman young Akila knows.

Luster

In 1995 Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, on a rare family vacation, seven-year-old Nainoa Flores falls overboard a cruise ship into the Pacific Ocean. When a shiver of sharks appears in the water, everyone fears for the worst. But instead, Noa is gingerly delivered to his mother in the jaws of a shark, marking his story as the stuff of legends.


Nainoa’s family, struggling amidst the collapse of the sugarcane industry, hails his rescue as a sign of favor from ancient Hawaiian gods—a belief that appears validated after he exhibits puzzling new abilities. But as time passes, this supposed divine favor begins to drive the family apart: Nainoa, working now as a paramedic on the streets of Portland, struggles to fathom the full measure of his expanding abilities; further north in Washington, his older brother Dean hurtles into the world of elite college athletics, obsessed with wealth and fame; while in California, risk-obsessed younger sister Kaui navigates an unforgiving academic workload in an attempt to forge her independence from the family’s legacy.


When supernatural events revisit the Flores family in Hawai’i—with tragic consequences—they are all forced to reckon with the bonds of family, the meaning of heritage, and the cost of survival.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234025.jpg,Kawai Strong Washburn,Macmillan US,2020,384,Tiếng Anh,Fantasy,https://www.fahasa.com/sharks-in-the-time-of-saviors.html

And it was also the day John Brennan said his final farewell to Owen Brennan, his father, the man who had taught him the lessons of goodness, integrity, and honor that had shaped the course of an unparalleled career serving his country from within the intelligence community.


In this brutally honest memoir, Brennan, the son of an Irish immigrant who settled in New Jersey, describes the life that took him from being a young CIA recruit enamored with the mystique of spy work, secretly defiant enough to drive a motorcycle and sport a diamond earring, and invigorated by his travels in the Middle East to being the most powerful individual in American intelligence. He details his experiences with very different presidents and what it’s been like to bear responsibility for some of the nation’s most crucial and polarizing national security decisions.


He pulls back the curtain on the inner workings of the Agency, describing the selfless, patriotic, and invisible work of the women and men involved in national security. He also examines the insularity, arrogance, and myopia that have, at times, undermined its reputation in the eyes of the American people and of members of other branches of government. Through topics ranging from George W. Bush’s intervention in Iraq to his thoughts on the CIA’s controversial use of enhanced interrogation techniques to his eye-opening account of the planning of the raid that resulted in Bin Ladin’s death to his realization that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election, Brennan brings the reader behind the scenes of some of the most crucial moments in recent U.S. history. He also candidly discusses the times he has failed to live up to his own high standards and the very public fallouts that have resulted. With its behind-the-scenes look at how major U.S. national security policies and actions unfolded during his long and distinguished career―especially during his eight years in the Obama administration―John Brennan’s memoir is a work of history with strong implications for the future of America and our country’s relationships with other world powers.


Undaunted: My Fight Against America’s Enemies, at Home and Abroad 
offers a rare and insightful look at the often-obscured world of national security, the intelligence profession, and Washington’s chaotic political environment. But more than that, it is a portrait of a man striving for integrity; for himself, for the CIA, and for his country.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234107.jpg,John O.

Let Love Rule,"Let Love Rule


THE 
NEW YORK TIMES 
BESTSELLER


“I see my story as a suite of songs that have a magical connection.”


Let Love Rule
 is a work of deep reflection. Lenny Kravitz looks back at his life with candor, self-scrutiny, and humor.


“My life is all about opposites,” he writes. “Black and white. Jewish and Christian. The Jackson 5 and Led Zeppelin. I accepted my Gemini soul. I owned it. I adored it. Yins and yangs mingled in various parts of my heart and mind, giving me balance and fueling my curiosity and comfort.”


Let Love Rule
 covers a vast canvas stretching from Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant, Los Angeles’s Baldwin Hills and Beverly Hills, and finally to France, England, and Germany.


It’s the story of a wildly creative kid who, despite tough struggles at school and extreme tension at home, finds salvation in music.


We see him grow as a musician and ultimately become a master songwriter, producer, and performer. We also see Lenny’s spiritual growth―and the powerful way in which spirit informs his music.


The cast of characters surrounding Lenny is extraordinary: his father, Sy, a high-powered news executive; his mother, Roxie Roker, a television star; and Lisa Bonet, the young actress who becomes his muse.


The central character, of course, is Lenny, who, despite his great aspirational energy, turns down record deal after record deal until he finds his true voice.


The creation of that voice, the same voice that is able to declare “Let Love Rule” to an international audience, is the very heart of this story.


“Whether recording, performing, or writing a book,” says Lenny, “my art is about listening to the inspiration inside and then sharing it with people. Art must bring the world closer together.”",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234074.jpg,"Lenny Kravitz, David Ritz",Macmillan US,2020,260,Tiếng Anh,Memoirs,https://www.fahasa.com/let-love-rule.html
Losing The Long Game: The False Promise Of Regime Change In The Middle East,"Losing The Long Game: The False Promise Of Regime Change In The Middle East


Since the end of World War II, the United States has set out to oust governments in the Middle East on an average of around once per decade. It has done so in places as diverse as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan (twice), Egypt, Libya, and Syria - to count only the instances where regime change was effectively U.S. policy and where Washington led the effort. The reasons for these interventions have also been extremely diverse, including countering communism, geopolitical competition, preventing the development of weapons of mass destruction, combatting terrorism, saving civilian lives, and promoting democracy. And the methods by which the United States pursued regime change have also been highly varied: sponsoring a military coup, providing covert or overt military assistance to opposition groups, invading and occupying, invading and not occupying, providing air power to opposition forces, or relying on diplomacy, rhetoric, and sanctions. What is common to all the operations, however, is that they failed to achieve their ultimate goals, produced a range of unintended and even catastrophic consequences, carried heavy financial and human costs, and in many cases left the countries in question worse off than they were before.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_234091.jpg,Philip H.

Graceling 
meets
 Red Queen 
in this exciting debut novel by an electrifying new voice


Hush has all the trappings of a great fantasy: a curse, a labyrinthine castle, many secrets, and powerful magic. At the center of it all, a girl unwilling to allow her world to be twisted by lies when she knows the truth. A truly gripping read. - Emily A. Duncan, 
New York Times 
bestselling author of 
Wicked Saints


They use magic to silence the world. Who will break the hush?


Seventeen-year-old Shae has led a seemingly quiet life, joking with her best friend Fiona, and chatting with Mads, the neighborhood boy who always knows how to make her smile. All while secretly keeping her fears at bay... Of the disease that took her brother's life. Of how her dreams seem to bleed into reality around her. Of a group of justice seekers called the Bards who claim to use the magic of 
Telling
 to keep her community safe.


When her mother is murdered, she can no longer pretend.


Not knowing who to trust, Shae journeys to unlock the truth, instead finding a new enemy keen to destroy her, a brooding boy with dark secrets, and an untold power she never thought possible.

Collins Reading For Ielts (Tái Bản),"If your reading is preventing you from getting the score you need in IELTS, Collins Reading for IELTS can help.


Don’t let one skill hold you back.


Collins Reading for IELTS
 has been specially created for learners of English who plan to take the Academic IELTS exam to demonstrate that they have the required ability to communicate effectively in English at university. It is ideal for learners with band score 5 – 5.5 who are aiming for band score 6 or higher on the IELTS test (CEF level B1 and above).


This major new edition has been thoroughly updated and improved to make it even easier to use. Now in full colour, the book has a new layout and a series of brand new features to help students feel fully prepared for their IELTS exam:


Enhanced answer keys with further explanations of why answers are right or wrong, or ambiguous


‘Watch out!’ boxes that highlight common IELTS mistakes


A revision checklist at the end of each section to remind students what they should do for each particular part of the exam


What is IELTS?


The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is the most common test used by universities for foreign students to prove their language level. IELTS is also increasingly used for immigration purposes, with many countries requiring visa applicants whose first language is not English to submit an IELTS grade. The system tests candidates’ Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking in four separate papers. Usually, students must gain a good mark in all four skills in order to gain entry to the course, job, or country of their choice. For this reason, candidates will often sit the exam numerous times to secure the score that they need.

"Promise Me, Dad","Promise Me, Dad


The Instant #1 New York Times Bestseller


'Biden splices a heartbreaking story with an election story and a foreign affairs story. And in so doing, he offers something for everyone, no matter which strand draws you in' - The New York Times Book Review


From President-Elect Joe Biden, winner of the 2020 United States presidential election, Promise Me Dad is his deeply moving memoir about the year that would forever change both a family and a country.


In November 2014, thirteen members of the Biden family gathered for their traditional Thanksgiving celebration. But this year felt different from previous. Joe and Jill Biden's eldest son, Beau, had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour fifteen months earlier, and his survival was uncertain. 'Promise me, Dad,' Beau had told his father. 'Give me your word that no matter what happens, you're going to be all right.' Joe Biden gave him his word.


Promise Me, Dad chronicles the year that followed, which would be the most momentous and challenging in Joe Biden's extraordinary life and career. Vice President Biden travelled more than a hundred thousand miles that year, across the world, dealing with crises in Ukraine, Central America and Iraq. While Beau fought for, and then lost his life, the Vice President balanced the twin imperatives of living up to his responsibilities to his country and his responsibilities to his family, while contemplating the insistent and urgent question of whether he should seek the presidency in 2016. Even in the worst times, Biden was able to lean on the strength of his long, deep bonds with his family, on his faith, and on his deepening friendship with the man in the Oval Office, Barack Obama.


Promise Me, Dad is a story of how family and friendships sustain us and how hope, purpose and action can guide us through the pain of personal loss into the light of a new future.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781509890088_2.jpg,Joe Biden,Macmillan Publishers,2017,290,Tiếng Anh,"Biography: Historical, Political & Military",https://www.fahasa.com/promise-me-dad-357160.html

K-Pop Confidential,"K-Pop Confidential


I'm still giddy over this electrifying, big-hearted, all-kill smash of a debut. I couldn't put it down. -- Becky Albertalli, bestselling author of 
Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda


In this romantic coming-of-age novel about chasing big dreams, a Korean-American girl travels to Seoul in hopes of debuting in a girl group at the same K-pop company behind the most popular boy band on the planet. Perfect for fans of Mary H. K. Choi and Jenny Han.


Candace Park knows a lot about playing a role. For most of her life, she's been playing the role of the quiet Korean girl who takes all AP classes and plays a classical instrument, keeping her dreams of stardom-and her obsession with SLK, K-pop's top boyband-to herself. She doesn't see how a regular girl like her could possibly become one of those K-pop goddesses she sees on YouTube. Even though she can sing. Like, 
really
 sing.So when Candace secretly enters a global audition held by SLK's music label, the last thing she expects is to actually get a coveted spot in their trainee program. And convincing her strict parents to let her to go is all but impossible ... although it's nothing compared to what comes next. Under the strict supervision of her instructors at the label's headquarters in Seoul, Candace must perfect her performance skills to within an inch of her life, learn to speak Korean fluently, and navigate the complex hierarchies of her fellow trainees, all while following the strict rules of the industry. Rule number one? NO DATING, which becomes impossible to follow when she meets a dreamy boy trainee. And in the all-out battle to debut, Candace is in danger of planting herself in the middle of a scandal lighting up the K-pop fandom around the world.If she doesn't have what it takes to become a perfect, hair-flipping K-pop idol, what will that mean for her family, who have sacrificed everything to give her the chance? And is a spot in the most hyped K-pop girl group of all time really worth risking her friendships, her future, and everything she believes in?",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781338639933.jpg,Stephan Lee,Scholastic,2020,323,Tiếng Anh,Romance,https://www.fahasa.com/k-pop-confidential.html

Marin is a smart, driven, popular girl – she's headed for Brown when she graduates and has a brilliant career as a journalist ahead of her. Especially in the eyes of English teacher Mr Beckett. He spends a lot of time around Marin, and she thinks it's harmless . . . until he kisses her.


No one believes Marin when she tells them what happened, so she does the only thing she can: she writes an article called 'Rules for Being a Girl' for the school paper to point out the misogyny and sexism that girls face every day. As things heat up at school and in her personal life, Marin must figure out how to take back the power and rewrite her own rules.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_228160.jpg,"Candace Bushnell, Katie Cotugno",Macmillan Publishers,2020,304,Tiếng Anh,Romance,https://www.fahasa.com/rules-for-being-a-girl.html

Summerwater,"Summerwater


The Sunday Times Top Ten Bestseller

'Superb' The Times

'Sharp, searching . . . utterly of the moment' Hilary Mantel, author of Wolf Hall

'So accomplished' Guardian

'A masterpiece' Jessie Burton, author of The Miniaturist

'One of her best' Irish Times

'Beautifully written, intense, powerful' David Nicholls, author of Sweet Sorrow


From the acclaimed author of Ghost Wall, Summerwater is a devastating story told over twenty-four hours in the Scottish highlands, and a searing exploration of our capacity for both kinship and cruelty in these divided times.


On the longest day of the summer, twelve people sit cooped up with their families in a faded Scottish cabin park. The endless rain leaves them with little to do but watch the other residents.


A woman goes running up the Ben as if fleeing; a retired couple reminisce about neighbours long since moved on; a teenage boy braves the dark waters of the loch in his red kayak. Each person is wrapped in their own cares but increasingly alert to the makeshift community around them. One particular family, a mother and daughter without the right clothes or the right manners, starts to draw the attention of the others. Tensions rise and all watch on, unaware of the tragedy that lies ahead as night finally falls.


'Nothing escapes her sly humour and brilliant touch. Deft and brimming with life, Summerwater is a novel of endless depth. A masterpiece.' Jessie Burton, author of The Miniaturist

The Joy Journal For Magical Everyday Play: Easy Activities & Creative Craft For Kids And Their Grown-Ups,"The Joy Journal For Magical Everyday Play: Easy Activities & Creative Craft For Kids And Their Grown-Ups


Foreword by Fearne Cotton.


The Joy Journal for Magical Everyday Play 
by Laura Brand showcases fifty engaging activities for creative, everyday playtime to encourage a connection to nature, sense of joy and bonding with your kids, while nurturing your own inner child too.


The activities are mindful, creative and, crucially, very easy things to make and do with children that you will enjoy as much as they will. From moon sand to flower soup and nature wands there are short, long, loud and quiet activities to take you from morning to evening – each with a focus on the risk factors: volume of effort vs child engagement and mess. Laura Brand has been testing these while writing and raising her two-under-two, and shares the happy accidents and road blocks she’s hit along the way in honest, open and often funny introductions to each of the exercises.


This beautiful handbook will help you to inject fun, mindfulness and craft into bath-times, rainy afternoons, long journeys and play dates and to resist (as much as possible!) the temptation to succumb to screen time. Chapters take you through the seasons, with indoor, outdoor and on-the-go activities that are easy and fun every day.


The Joy Journal
 will arm you with a variety of fun, focussed activities made with store cupboard and easily foraged supplies that you can turn to time and again. All activities are suitable for toddlers, pre-schoolers, grown-ups and everyone in between.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_228124.jpg,"Laura Brand, Fearne Cotton",Macmillan Publishers,2020,208,Tiếng Anh,Crafts and Hobbies,https://www.fahasa.com/the-joy-journal-for-magical-everyday-play-easy-activities-creative-craft-for-kids-and-their-grown-ups.html

A chimerical blend of magic, power, hope, and freedom that stretches across time, touching diverse members of two black families,
 Lovecraft Country

Chicago, 1954.

On their journey to the manor of Mr. Braithwhite – heir to the estate that owned one of Atticus’s ancestors – they encounter both mundane terrors of white America and malevolent spirits that seem straight out of the weird tales George devours.


At the manor, Atticus discovers his father in chains, held prisoner by a secret cabal named the Order of the Ancient Dawn – led by Samuel Braithwhite and his son Caleb – which has gathered to orchestrate a ritual that shockingly centers on Atticus. And his one hope of salvation may be the seed of his – and the whole Turner clan’s – destruction.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_227866.jpg,Matt Ruff,Macmillan Publishers,2020,256,Tiếng Anh,Fantasy,https://www.fahasa.com/lovecraft-country-tv-tie-in.html

Egg,"Egg


A hilarious picture book about a non-conforming Egg from the bestselling Sue Hendra and Paul Linnet.


Important note: This book is not like other books. This is a book that even the smallest children can read. This is a book which will stretch your imagination, celebrate difference and fire up your storytelling brain. This is a book with just one word... Egg.


When an odd egg turns up with a big head and a pointy bottom, the other eggs don't know what to make of it. Can they make the odd egg conform to Normal Egg Standards? The other eggs try turning it upside down, and even make it wear a hat on its bottom to show which side is 'up', but it takes the clever upside-down egg to show them that eggs can be any way up and still be eggs.


Perfect for Easter, or any time of the year, children will love telling the story themselves, looking at the pictures and using different voices for the various 'egg's. Plus the egg-shaped format adds to the eggy fun!",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_227470.jpg,"Sue Hendra, Paul Linnet",Macmillan Publishers,2020,32,Tiếng Anh,Picture Books,https://www.fahasa.com/egg-353685.html

Lessons For Ielts Writing,"Lessons For Ielts Writing


IELTS, the International English Language Testing System, is one of the world’s most popular English language tests for entry into university or higher education where English is the language of communication. In other words, it is your academic passport!


One of the most difficult challenges you will face in a Academic Writing Test is being able to respond to Task 1 and Task 2 questions appropriately. In this book, you will be guided to produce the kind of writing that is required.


Grammar is very important. You will learn the most common verb tenses and how to use them as well as the correct grammar structures for a variety of language functions that you will need to answer Task 1 (comparing, contrasting, etc.) and Task 2 (evaluating, discussing, giving opinions, etc.)


You will learn coherence, that is, how to link your ideas together fluently and how to organise your writing into coherent paragraphs.


Specific vocabulary is targeted for Task 1 to enable you to write about data, trends, and changes. In addition, typical vocabulary related to common topics of Task 2 is introduced.


As you work through this book, you will become aware of how to respond appropriately, accurately, and relevantly to the requirements set out in each IELTS Writing task.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9786045840689_1.jpg,New Oriental Education,Cty Nhân Trí Việt,2021,208,Tiếng Anh,Luyện Thi IELTS ,https://www.fahasa.com/lessons-for-ielts-writing-349428.html

"Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors, And The Drug Company That Addicted America","Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors, And The Drug Company That Addicted America


Journalist Beth Macy's definitive account of America's opioid 
epidemic ""masterfully interlaces stories of communities in crisis with dark histories of corporate greed and regulatory indifference"" (
New York Times
) -- from the boardroom to the courtroom and into the living rooms of 
Americans.
 In this extraordinary work, Beth Macy takes us into the epicenter of a national drama that has unfolded over two decades. From the labs and marketing departments of big pharma to local doctor's offices; wealthy suburbs to distressed small communities in Central Appalachia; from distant cities to once-idyllic farm towns; the spread of opioid addiction follows a tortuous trajectory that illustrates how this crisis has persisted for so long and become so firmly entrenched.


Beginning with a single dealer who lands in a small Virginia town and sets about turning high school football stars into heroin overdose statistics, Macy sets out to answer a grieving mother's question-why her only son died-and comes away with a gripping, unputdownable story of greed and need. From the introduction of OxyContin in 1996, Macy investigates the powerful forces that led America's doctors and patients to embrace a medical culture where overtreatment with painkillers became the norm. In some of the same communities featured in her bestselling book 
Factory Man
, the unemployed use painkillers both to numb the pain of joblessness and pay their bills, while privileged teens trade pills in cul-de-sacs, and even high school standouts fall prey to prostitution, jail, and death.


Through unsparing, compelling, and unforgettably humane portraits of families and first responders determined to ameliorate this epidemic, each facet of the crisis comes into focus. In these politically fragmented times, Beth Macy shows that one thing uniting Americans across geographic, partisan, and class lines is opioid drug abuse. But even in the midst of twin crises in drug abuse and healthcare, Macy finds reason to hope and ample signs of the spirit and tenacity that are helping the countless ordinary people ensnared by addiction build a better future for themselves, their families, and their communities.


""An impressive feat of journalism, monumental in scope and urgent in its implications."" -- Jennifer Latson, 
The Boston Globe",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_221616.jpg,Beth Macy,Hachette Book Group,2019,400,Tiếng Anh,Coping With Drug & Alcohol Abuse,https://www.fahasa.com/dopesick-dealers-doctors-and-the-drug-company-that-addicted-america.html
The Friend Zone,"The Friend Zone


Fall in love with this hilarious and heartwarming 
USA Today 
bestselling romantic comedy that LJ Shen calls ""an absolute treat.""


Kristen Peterson doesn't do drama, will fight to the death for her friends, and has no room in her life for guys who just don't get her. She's also keeping a big secret: facing a medically necessary procedure that will make it impossible for her to have children.


Planning her best friend's wedding is bittersweet for Kristen -- especially when she meets the best man, Josh Copeland. He's funny, sexy, never offended by her mile-wide streak of sarcasm, and always one chicken enchilada ahead of her hangry. Even her dog, Stuntman Mike, adores him. The only catch: Josh wants a big family someday. Kristen knows he'd be better off with someone else, but as their attraction grows, it's harder and harder to keep him at arm's length.


The Friend Zone
 will have you laughing one moment and grabbing for tissues the next as it tackles the realities of infertility and loss with wit, heart, and a lot of sass.

A Raisin In The Sun: The Unfilmed Original Screenplay (Plume),"A Raisin In The Sun: The Unfilmed Original Screenplay (Plume)


Under the editorship of the late Robert Nemiroff, with a provocative and thoughtful introduction by preeminent African-American scholar Margaret B. Wilkerson and a commentary by Spike Lee, this completely restored screenplay is the accurate and authoritative edition of Lorraine Hansberry's script and a testament to her unparalled accomplishment as a black woman artist.


The 1961 film version of 
A Raisin in the Sun
, with a screenplay by the author, Lorraine Hansberry, won an award at the Cannes Film Festival even though one-third of the actual screenplay Hansberry had written had been cut out. The film did essentially bring Hansberry's extraordinary play to the screen, but it failed to fulfill her cinematic vision.


Now, with this landmark edition of Lorraine Hansberry's original script for the movie of 
A Raisin in the Sun
 that audiences never viewed, readers have at hand an epic, eloquent work capturing not only the life and dreams of a black family, but the Chicago--and the society--that surround and shape them.


Important changes in dialogue and exterior shots, a stunning shift of focus to her male protagonist, and a dramatic rewriting of the final scene show us an artist who understood and used the cinematic medium to transform a stage play into a different art form--a profound and powerful film.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_216770.jpg,"Hansberry (Author), Michael F.

WAR HORSE


Meet the Little Prince, a young fellow who hails from a tiny, distant planet. He loves to watch sunsets and look after his flower, to ask questions and to laugh. And now here he is on Earth, appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the desert, looking for a friend. The friend he finds is the narrator of this story – a pilot who has crash landed and is in grave danger of dying of thirst.


The Little Prince might be just a boy but he can help our pilot. Because he understands the really important things in life – things like flowers, stars, a drink of water or laughing. Many grown-ups have lost sight of what matters and children have to remember to be tolerant towards them. But adult or child, very silly or very wise, this story is for you.

A rediscovered
 masterpiece by the 16 million copy bestselling author of 
Man’s Search For Meaning


Just months after his liberation from Auschwitz renowned psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl delivered a series of talks revealing the foundations of his life-affirming philosophy. The psychologist, who would soon become world famous, explained his central thoughts on meaning, resilience and his conviction that every crisis contains opportunity.


Published here for the very first time in English, Frankl's words resonate as strongly today as they did in 1946. Despite the unspeakable horrors in the camp, Frankl learnt from his fellow inmates that it is always possible to say ‘yes to life’ – a profound and timeless lesson for us all.


With an introduction by Daniel Goleman.

36: A dream came true, but it feels different than you thought.


45: Do you like yourself as you are?


75: You learn to unlearn things. Can you still do a somersault?


86: Everything can be different in every moment.


How does our perception of the world change in the course of a lifetime? When Heike Faller's niece was born she began to wonder what we learn in life, and how we can talk about what we have learnt with those we love. And so she began to ask everyone she met, what did you learn in life? Out of the answers of children's writers and refugees, teenagers and artists, mothers and friends, came 99 lessons: that those who have had a difficult time appreciate the good moments more. That those who have had it easy find it harder getting old. That a lot of getting old is about accepting boundaries. And of course, as one 94 year old said to her, 'sometimes I feel like that little girl I once was, and I wonder if I have learned anything at all.'

The Ride Of A Lifetime: Lessons Learned From 15 Years As Ceo Of The Walt Disney Company,"The Ride Of A Lifetime: Lessons Learned From 15 Years As Ceo Of The Walt Disney Company


#1 
NEW YORK TIMES 
BESTSELLER • 
A memoir of leadership and success
: The executive chairman of Disney, 
Time
’s 2019 businessperson of the year, shares the ideas and values he embraced 
during his fifteen years as CEO while reinventing one of the world’s most beloved companies 
and inspiring the people who bring the magic to life.


NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR


Robert Iger became CEO of The Walt Disney Company in 2005, during a difficult time. Competition was more intense than ever and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company’s history. His vision came down to three clear ideas: Recommit to the concept that quality matters, embrace technology instead of fighting it, and think bigger—think global—and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.


Today, Disney is the largest, most admired media company in the world, counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and he is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our era.


In 
The Ride of a Lifetime
, Robert Iger shares the lessons he learned while running Disney and leading its 220,000-plus employees, and he explores the principles that are necessary for true leadership, including:


- 
Optimism.
 Even in the face of difficulty, an optimistic leader will find the path toward the best possible outcome and focus on that, rather than give in to pessimism and blaming.

- 
Courage.
 Leaders have to be willing to take risks and place big bets. Fear of failure destroys creativity.

- 
Decisiveness.
 All decisions, no matter how difficult, can be made on a timely basis. Indecisiveness is both wasteful and destructive to morale.

- 
Fairness.
 Treat people decently, with empathy, and be accessible to them.


This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as the lowliest studio grunt at ABC. It’s also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the 
Star Wars
 mythology.


“The ideas in this book strike me as universal” Iger writes. “Not just to the aspiring CEOs of the world, but to anyone wanting to feel less fearful, more confidently 
themselves,
 as they navigate their professional and even personal lives.”",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_215940.jpg,Robert Iger,Random House,2019,272,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Business & Industry,https://www.fahasa.com/the-ride-of-a-lifetime-lessons-learned-from-15-years-as-ceo-of-the-walt-disney-company.html
Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection Of My Hasidic Roots,"Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection Of My Hasidic Roots


Now a Netflix original series!


Unorthodox
 is the bestselling memoir of a young Jewish woman’s escape from a religious sect, in the tradition of Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s 
Infidel 
and Carolyn Jessop’s 
Escape
, featuring a new epilogue by the author.


As a member of the strictly religious Satmar sect of Hasidic Judaism, Deborah Feldman grew up under a code of relentlessly enforced customs governing everything from what she could wear and to whom she could speak to what she was allowed to read. Yet in spite of her repressive upbringing, Deborah grew into an independent-minded young woman whose stolen moments reading about the empowered literary characters of Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott helped her to imagine an alternative way of life among the skyscrapers of Manhattan. Trapped as a teenager in a sexually and emotionally dysfunctional marriage to a man she barely knew, the tension between Deborah’s desires and her responsibilities as a good Satmar girl grew more explosive until she gave birth at nineteen and realized that, regardless of the obstacles, she would have to forge a path—for herself and her son—to happiness and freedom.

As twins, the Bellas have always competed. Legend has it that Nikki drop-kicked Brie in the womb so that she could make her grand entrance first. But the rest of the world often treated them as identical and even interchangeable, so they decided to do something about it.


After they made it into WWE, the Bellas accomplished so much together: bringing in young girls and women while building the Bella Army, helping the transition of female performers from Divas to Superstars, starring in 
Total Divas
 and 
Total Bellas
, and founding companies like Birdiebee, Nicole + Brizee Beauty, and Bonita Bonita Wine.


Though their early journey began with loss, abuse, and plenty of rough times, these challenges “shined the diamond.” They resolved to be survivors and the heroes of their own stories, and to take control and responsibility for their lives. Eventually, they would come to show girls everywhere that they can do 
anything

After all, ten days of bliss is worth having to assume the role of loving newlyweds, right? But the weird thing is . . . Olive doesn’t mind playing pretend.

At the age of sixteen, Edith Eger was sent to Auschwitz. Hours after her parents were killed, Nazi officer Dr. Josef Mengele, forced Edie to dance for his amusement and her survival. Edie was pulled from a pile of corpses when the American troops liberated the camps in 1945.


Edie spent decades struggling with flashbacks and survivor’s guilt, determined to stay silent and hide from the past. Thirty-five years after the war ended, she returned to Auschwitz and was finally able to fully heal and forgive the one person she’d been unable to forgive—herself.


Edie weaves her remarkable personal journey with the moving stories of those she has helped heal. She explores how we can be imprisoned in our own minds and shows us how to find the key to freedom.

The Alter Ego Effect : The Power Of Secret Identities To Transform Your Life,"The Alter Ego Effect : The Power Of Secret Identities To Transform Your Life


Now a Wall Street Journal bestseller.


What if the games we played as children were the greatest gift to helping us achieve more today?


Before stage fright, impostor syndrome, emotional baggage, and the other dubious gifts of adulthood, everyone pretended to be a superhero, a favorite athlete, an inspiring entertainer, a nurse, a firefighter, a lion, or whatever else captured our imaginations. And yet, that natural creativity is slowly squeezed out of us because we think it's childish or it's ""time to grow up."" Now Todd Herman-backed by scientific research and countless stories from the real world-will show us how to tap into the human imagination to unleash new versions of ourselves, ready-made to kick ass.


Herman has been coaching champions in every field for over twenty years, and he's helped them bring out their Heroic Self to transcend the forces pulling them into the Ordinary World.


Anyone attempting ambitious things faces adversity, resistance, and challenges, but Herman confronts these obstacles with a question: Who or what needs to show up to make success inevitable?


In The Alter Ego Effect, Herman presents countless stories from salespeople, executives, entertainers, athletes, entrepreneurs, creatives, and historical figures to illustrate how to activate the Heroic Self already nested inside each of us. And he reveals that we may not be using those traits in the moments when we need them the most. From the creative entrepreneur who resisted their craft, to the accomplished military officer who wanted to be a warmer dad at home, Todd Herman's clients have discovered there is no end to the parts of their lives they could improve by using Alter Egos.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780062838636.jpg,Todd Herman,HarperCollins Publishers,2019,272,Tiếng Anh,"Assertiveness, Motivation & Self-esteem",https://www.fahasa.com/the-alter-ego-effect-the-power-of-secret-identities-to-transform-your-life.html

Let Them Eat Chaos: Mercury Prize Shortlisted,"Let Them Eat Chaos: Mercury Prize Shortlisted


SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2017 MERCURY MUSIC PRIZE


Let Them Eat Chaos
, Kate Tempest's new long poem written for live performance and heard on the album release of the same name, is both a powerful sermon and a moving play for voices. Seven neighbours inhabit the same London street, but are all unknown to each other. The clock freezes in the small hours, and, one by one, we see directly into their lives: lives that are damaged, disenfranchised, lonely, broken, addicted, and all, apparently, without hope. Then a great storm breaks over London, and brings them out into the night to face each other - and their last chance to connect. Tempest argues that our alienation from one another has bred a terrible indifference to our own fate, but she counters this with a plea to challenge the forces of greed which have conspired to divide us, and mend the broken home of our own planet while we still have time. 
Let Them Eat Chaos
 is a 
cri de coeur
 and a call to action, and, both on the page and in Tempest's electric performance, one of the most powerful poetic statements of the year.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_220213.jpg,Kae Tempest,Macmillan Publishers,2016,80,Tiếng Anh,Poetry,https://www.fahasa.com/let-them-eat-chaos.html
Things Fall Apart,"Things Fall Apart


“A true classic of world literature . . . A masterpiece that has inspired generations of writers in Nigeria, across Africa, and around the world.” 
—
Barack Obama 


“African literature is incomplete and unthinkable without the works of Chinua Achebe.” —Toni Morrison


Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s 
The Great American Read


Things Fall Apart
 is the first of three novels in Chinua Achebe's critically acclaimed African Trilogy. It is a classic narrative about Africa's cataclysmic encounter with Europe as it establishes a colonial presence on the continent. Told through the fictional experiences of Okonkwo, a wealthy and fearless Igbo warrior of Umuofia in the late 1800s, 
Things Fall Apart 
explores one man's futile resistance to the devaluing of his Igbo traditions by British political andreligious forces and his despair as his community capitulates to the powerful new order.


With more than 20 million copies sold and translated into fifty-seven languages, 
Things Fall Apart 
provides one of the most illuminating and permanent monuments to African experience. Achebe does not only capture life in a pre-colonial African village, he conveys the tragedy of the loss of that world while broadening our understanding of our contemporary realities.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_231259.jpg,Chinua Achebe,Penguin Books,2008,224,Tiếng Anh,Historical Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/things-fall-apart-315057.html

Diary Of An Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal (Diary Of A Wimpy Kid),"Diary Of An Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal (Diary Of A Wimpy Kid)


A DIARY OF A WIMPY KID STORY that will have you rolling with laughter, from number one bestselling author Jeff Kinney!


Hi my name is Rowley Jefferson and this is my book. Now I have a diary just like my friend Greg...


Rowley's best friend Greg Heffley has chronicled his middle-school years in thirteen 
Diary of a Wimpy Kid
 journals. Now it's Rowley's turn to give 
his
 side of the story.


But Rowley has agreed to tell Greg's story along the way, too. (After all, Greg says one day he will be rich and famous and the world will need to know how he managed it).


But Rowley's stories about Greg might not be quite what his friend had in mind . . .


Praise for Jeff Kinney:


'The books contain meaty themes to do with family and friendship [...] more please'. 
The Telegraph


'No-one does the straight to camera narrative style of the diary better than Kinney ... This is as authentic and funny as the original Wimpy Kid books and makes just as irresistible reading.' 
- 
Andrea Reece, LoveReading4Kids Reviewer


'Kinney is right up there with J K Rowling as one of the bestselling children's authors on the planet'

Boy In The Well,"Boy In The Well


DI WESTPHALL.
No ordinary detective.
No ordinary investigations.


A twisting new crime series set in the Scottish Highlands. For fans of Stephen King, Christopher Brookmyre and John Connolly.


'A dark and satisfying mystery . . . This one comes thoroughly recommended' James Oswald


The body of a young boy is discovered at the bottom of a well that has been sealed for two hundred years. Yet the corpse is only days old . . .


No one comes forward to identify #Boy9, and DI Ben Westphall's only suspects are the farmers on whose land the well sits. They certainly seem as though they have something to hide. But it might not be what he thinks.


Soon, similarities from an old crime emerge and Westphall must look to the past to piece together the dark and twisted events taking place in the present.


********


WHAT READERS ARE SAYING ABOUT BOY IN THE WELL


'Intricately and expertly plotted . . . What an ending! One which left me wholly satisfied'


'The mystery surrounding #Boy9 as he comes to be known is a genuine puzzle and had me hooked from start to finish as I was desperate to know who he was and how he got there'

Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass,"Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass


THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED DEBUT BOOK OF POETRY FROM LANA DEL REY, 
VIOLET BENT BACKWARDS OVER THE GRASS


“
Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass
 is the title poem of the book and the first poem I wrote of many. Some of which came to me in their entirety, which I dictated and then typed out, and some that I worked laboriously picking apart each word to make the perfect poem. They are eclectic and honest and not trying to be anything other than what they are and for that reason I’m proud of them, especially because the spirit in which they were written was very authentic.” —
Lana Del Rey


Lana’s breathtaking first book solidifies her further as “the essential writer of her times” (
The Atlantic
). The collection features more than thirty poems, many exclusive to the book: 
Never to Heaven, The Land of 1,000 Fires, Past the Bushes Cypress Thriving, LA Who Am I to Love You?, Tessa DiPietro, Happy, Paradise Is Very Fragile, Bare Feet on Linoleum

Hanoi Traces Of The Old Days,"Hanoi Traces Of The Old Days


Architectures of Hanoi from 11th to the early 18th century are almost all buried under the ground and only discovered during the archeological excavations. Although Hanoi has gone through many devastations, including the Citadel and many religious architectures “razed to the ground” by the French, one still can find many structures existed prior to the French’s arrival and during their occupation.


Fortunately we still can see the Flag Tower and the Gates of the famous Citadel of Hanoi. The book also introduces you the mandarins who occupied the Citadel.


The Vietnamese used to call Hanoi the Market, since a large market was held in the city four or five times each month. From the simple street vendors who sell meat or carrying fire wood to sell at the door steps… to the flower girls who sell the sophisticated narcissus flowers are introduced in the Market chapter.


The Hanoi business areas used to be divided into guilds, with each guild normally occupying its own street. And, naturally the street bears the name of the commodity the businessmen are dealing with: Hang Bac (silver) street was the abode of the silver and gold smiths; one go to Hang Tre (bamboo) street to buy bamboos… to Hang Duong (sugar) to buy cakes and candies; to Hang Non (hat) street to buy hats…


The “Old Trades in the City” shows you the trade of weaving employing rudimentary tools and looms; rice husking also with simple rice hulling mill and rice mortar; and fishing, hat making, oil pressing… with simple tools and methods. The wheelbarrows were the most common means of transport since they were suitable for any terrain. And, for people’s transport, the rickshaws that first arrived in Hanoi during 1884 have become the most common mode of transport in the city. A tea shop may occupied a corner of a street but a barber may put his tool on any suitable place to do his trade. A shoe maker or repairer who just roving through the streets. The more sophisticated trades are painting, decorating, wood carving, mother-of-pearl inlaying, embroidering... and the elderly scholars sitting on the pavement with paper, ink and brush ready to write upon request and entertainment troupes seen on the road of Hanoi.


Introducing the West Lake also means introducing the existing famous pagodas of Quan Thanh, Tran Quoc… and the trade of paper making or to be more precise a village of paper making and fishing.


The “Hoan Kiem Lake” introduces you many photos of the pagodas and structures around the lake that were demolished after the arrival of the French. However, you can still see the Ngoc Son Temple, Tortoise Tower, Brush (or pen) Tower…


And, naturally, the new look of Hanoi bears the signature of the colonial architectures such as the Hanoi Post Office, the Hanoi Cathédrale Saint-Josseph, the Indochina University, the Hanoi Municipal Theatre, the École française d’Extrȇme-Orient’s museum, the Hanoi Railway Station, the Métropole Hotel, the Lycée Albert Sarraut secondary school…",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195820.jpg,Artbook,Cty Sách Á Châu,2017,180,Tiếng Anh,Photographs: Collections,https://www.fahasa.com/hanoi-traces-of-the-old-days-309474.html

WINNER OF THE BLUE PETER BOOK AWARD 2019


WINNER OF THE WATERSTONES CHILDREN'S BOOK PRIZE 2019


SHORTLISTED FOR THE JHALAK PRIZE 2019


Told with heart and humour, The Boy at the Back of the Class is a child's perspective on the refugee crisis, highlighting the importance of friendship and kindness in a world that doesn't always make sense.


There used to be an empty chair at the back of my class, but now a new boy called Ahmet is sitting in it.


He's nine years old (just like me), but he's very strange. He never talks and never smiles and doesn't like sweets - not even lemon sherbets, which are my favourite!


But then I learned the truth: Ahmet really isn't very strange at all. He's a refugee who's run away from a War. A real one. With bombs and fires and bullies that hurt people. And the more I find out about him, the more I want to help.


That's where my best friends Josie, Michael and Tom come in. Because you see, together we've come up with a plan. . .

Eclipse: 3 (Twilight Saga),"Eclipse: 3 (Twilight Saga)


Bella?'


Edward's soft voice came from behind me. I turned to see him spring lightly up the porch steps, his hair windblown from running. He pulled me into his arms at once, and kissed me again. His kiss frightened me. There was too much tension, too strong an edge to the way his lips crushed mine - like he was afraid we had only so much time left to us.


As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge, Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob - knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation approaching, Bella has one more decision to make: life or death. But which is which?

His nearly 200 published works have stood the test of time, and have always been regarded as much-loved friends by children (and whoever used to be a child).

A Promised Land,"A Promised Land


A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making—from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy


In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency—a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil.


Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nation’s highest office.


Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating 
Deepwater Horizon
 blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.


A Promised Land
 is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.


This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781524763169.jpg,Barack Obama,Random House,2020,768,Tiếng Anh,"Biography: Historical, Political & Military",https://www.fahasa.com/a-promised-land.html

A beautifully moving tale of loss and reaching out to the ones we love, of one man’s journey to discover what really matters in modern life.


Our narrator’s days are numbered. Estranged from his family, living alone with only his cat Cabbage for company, he was unprepared for the doctor’s diagnosis that he has only months to live. But before he can set about tackling his bucket list, the Devil appears with a special offer: in exchange for making one thing in the world disappear, he can have one extra day of life. And so begins a very bizarre week . . .

Government minister Patrick Macready has been found dead in his flat. The coroner rules it an accident, a sex game gone wrong.


Jon Swift is from the old stock of journos - cynical, cantankerous and overweight - and something about his friend's death doesn't seem right. Then days after Macready's flat is apparently burgled, Swift discovers that his friend had been researching a string of Russian government figures who had met similarly 'accidental' fates.


When the police refuse to investigate further, Swift gets in touch with his contacts in Moscow, determined to find out if his hunch is correct.

No Rules Rules : Netflix And The Culture Of Reinvention,"No Rules Rules : Netflix And The Culture Of Reinvention


*** Longlisted for the 2020 Financial Times & McKinsey Business Book of the Year ***


It's time to do things differently.


Trust your team. Be radically honest. And never, ever try to please your boss.


These are some of the ground rules if you work at Netflix. They are part of a unique cultural experiment that explains how the company has transformed itself at lightning speed from a DVD mail order service into a streaming superpower - with 190 million fervent subscribers and a market capitalisation that rivals the likes of Disney.


Finally Reed Hastings, Netflix Chairman and CEO, is sharing the secrets that have revolutionised the entertainment and tech industries. With INSEAD business school professor Erin Meyer, he will explore his leadership philosophy - which begins by rejecting the accepted beliefs under which most companies operate - and how it plays out in practice at Netflix.


From unlimited holidays to abolishing approvals, Netflix offers a fundamentally different way to run any organisation, one far more in tune with an ever-changing fast-paced world. For anyone interested in creativity, productivity and innovation, the Netflix culture is something close to a holy grail. This book will make it, and its creator, fully accessible for the first time.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780753553664.jpg,"REED HASTINGS, Erin Meyer",Penguin Books,2020,320,Tiếng Anh,Office & Workplace,https://www.fahasa.com/no-rules-rules-netflix-and-the-culture-of-reinvention.html

How To Make A Vaccine: An Essential Guide For COVID-19 And Beyond,"How To Make A Vaccine: An Essential Guide For COVID-19 And Beyond


Distinguished expert in vaccine development John Rhodes tells the story of the first approved COVID-19 vaccines and offers an essential, up-to-the-minute primer on how scientists discover, test, and distribute vaccines.


As the COVID-19 pandemic has affected every corner of the world, changing our relationship to our communities, to our jobs, and to each other, the most pressing question has been—when will it end? Researchers around the globe are urgently trying to answer this question by racing to test and distribute a vaccine that could end the greatest public health threat of our time.  In 
How to Make a Vaccine, 
an expert who has firsthand experience developing vaccines tells an optimistic story of how three hundred years of vaccine discovery and a century and a half of immunology research have come together at this powerful moment—and will lead to multiple COVID-19 vaccines.


Dr. John Rhodes draws on his experience as an immunologist, including working alongside a young Anthony Fauci, to unravel the mystery of how vaccines are designed, tested, and produced at scale for global deployment. Concise and accessible, this book describes in everyday language how the immune system evolved to combat infection, how viruses responded by evolving ways to evade our defenses, and how vaccines do their work. That history, and the pace of current research developments, make Rhodes hopeful that multiple vaccines will protect us. Today the complex workings of the immune system are well understood. The tools needed by biomedical scientists stand ready to be used, and more than 160 vaccine candidates have already been produced. But defeating COVID-19 won’t be the end of the story: Rhodes describes how discoveries today are also empowering scientists to combat future threats to global health, including a recent breakthrough in the development of genetic vaccines, which have never before been used in humans.


As the world prepares for a vaccine, Rhodes offers a current and informative look at the science and strategies that deliver solutions to the crisis.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780226792514.jpg,John Rhodes,Apd (Thames) Singapore PTE Ltd,2021,160,Tiếng Anh,Pathology,https://www.fahasa.com/how-to-make-a-vaccine-an-essential-guide-for-covid-19-and-beyond.html

Newbery Medalist Erin Entrada Kelly’s 
Hello, Universe
 is a funny and poignant neighborhood story about unexpected friendships. 
This middle grade novel is an excellent choice for tween readers in grades 5 to 6, especially during homeschooling. It’s a fun way to keep your child entertained and engaged while not in the classroom.

bayani
 (hero). “Readers will be instantly engrossed in this relatable neighborhood adventure and its eclectic cast of misfits.”—
Booklist


In one day, four lives weave together in unexpected ways. Virgil Salinas is shy and kindhearted and feels out of place in his crazy-about-sports family. Valencia Somerset, who is deaf, is smart, brave, and secretly lonely, and she loves everything about nature. Kaori Tanaka is a self-proclaimed psychic, whose little sister, Gen, is always following her around. And Chet Bullens wishes the weird kids would just stop being so different so he can concentrate on basketball.


They aren’t friends, at least not until Chet pulls a prank that traps Virgil and his pet guinea pig at the bottom of a well. This disaster leads Kaori, Gen, and Valencia on an epic quest to find missing Virgil. Through luck, smarts, bravery, and a little help from the universe, a rescue is performed, a bully is put in his place, and friendship blooms.

Becoming: Adapted For Younger Readers,"Becoming: Adapted For Younger Readers


*A younger reader's edition of the number-one bestselling memoir by former first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama. With a new introduction from Mrs Obama herself*


What's important is our story, our whole story, including those moments when we feel a little vulnerable . . .


Michelle Robinson started life sharing a bedroom with her older brother Craig, in their family's upstairs apartment in her great-aunt's house. Her parents, Fraser and Marian, poured their love and energy into their children. She would go on to become Michelle Obama, the inspirational First Lady of the United States of America.


Now adapted for younger readers, with new photographs and a new introduction from Michelle Obama herself, this memoir tells a very personal, and completely inspiring, story of how, through hard work and determination, the girl from the South Side of Chicago built an extraordinary life.


A tale of ups and downs, triumphs and failures, this is an incredibly honest account. It will take you from the early years - first kiss, first school, first love - to the wonders of the White House, and the moment Mrs Obama shook hands with the Queen of England.


A book to read, share, and talk about with the adults in your life, this is a call to action and compassion, and hope for change in uncertain times, and in a scary world.


You'll be inspired to help others, and understand that no one is perfect. Just like Michelle Obama, you too are finding out exactly who you want to be (and, actually, so are the adults in your life).


Above all, it is a book to make you think: who are you, and what do you want to become?",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780241531815.jpg,Michelle Obama,Penguin Books,2021,432,Tiếng Anh,"Biography: Historical, Political & Military",https://www.fahasa.com/becoming-adapted-for-younger-readers.html

13 Things Mentally Strong Women Don't Do,"13 Things Mentally Strong Women Don't Do


In the time of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movement, international bestselling author and leading global expert on mental strength Amy Morin turns her focus to feminism, explaining what it means--and what it takes--to be a mentally strong woman.The emergence of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements have awakened society and encouraged women to find their voice and claim their power. But to do this, women must learn to improve their own mental strength. Contending with a host of difficult issues--from sexual assault on college campuses, to equal pay and pay gaps, to mastering different negotiation styles--demands psychological toughness. In this crucial book, prominent psychotherapist and licensed clinical social worker Amy Morin gives women the techniques to build mental muscle--and just as important, she teaches them what not to do.


What does it mean to be a mentally strong woman? Delving into critical issues like sexism, social media, social comparison, and social pressure, Amy addresses this question and offers thoughtful, intelligent advice, practical tips, and specific strategies and combines them with personal experiences, stories from former patients, and both well-known and untold examples from women from across industries and pop culture. Throughout, she explores the areas women--and society at large--must focus on to become (and remain) mentally strong.


Amy reveals that healthy, mentally tough women don't insist on perfection; they don't compare themselves to other people; they don't see vulnerability as a weakness; they don't let self-doubt stop them from reaching their goals. Wise, grounded, and essential, 13 Things Mentally Strong Women Don't Do can help every woman flourish--and ultimately improve our society as well.

Now a Netflix film starring and directed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, this is a gripping memoir of survival and perseverance about the heroic young inventor who brought electricity to his Malawian village. When a terrible drought struck William Kamkwamba's tiny village in Malawi, his family lost all of the season's crops, leaving them with nothing to eat and nothing to sell. William began to explore science books in his village library, looking for a solution. There, he came up with the idea that would change his family's life forever: he could build a windmill. Made out of scrap metal and old bicycle parts, William's windmill brought electricity to his home and helped his family pump the water they needed to farm the land. Retold for a younger audience, this exciting memoir shows how, even in a desperate situation, one boy's brilliant idea can light up the world.

Fire And Blood: 300 Years Before A Game Of Thrones (A Song Of Ice And Fire),"Fire And Blood: 300 Years Before A Game Of Thrones (A Song Of Ice And Fire)


Set 300 years before the events in A Song of Ice and Fire, Fire and Blood is the definitive history of the Targaryens in Westeros as told by Archmaester Gyldayn, and chronicles the conquest that united the Seven Kingdoms under Targaryen rule through the Dance of the Dragons: the Targaryen civil war that nearly ended their dynasty forever.


The thrilling history of the Targaryens comes to life in this masterly work by the author of A Song of Ice and Fire, the inspiration for HBO’s Game of Thrones.


With all the fire and fury fans have come to expect from internationally best-selling author George R.R. Martin, this is the first volume of the definitive two-part history of the Targaryens in Westeros.


Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen – the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria – took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire and Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart.


What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why did it become so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What is the origin of Daenerys’s three dragon eggs? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice & Fire but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed.


With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire and Blood is the ultimate game of thrones, giving readers a whole new appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody, and always fascinating history of Westeros.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_48483.jpg,George R.R.

The Ickabog is coming… A mythical monster, a kingdom in peril, an adventure that will test two children’s bravery to the limit. Discover a brilliantly original fairy tale about the power of hope and friendship to triumph against all odds, from one of the world’s best storytellers.


The kingdom of Cornucopia was once the happiest in the world. It had plenty of gold, a king with the finest moustaches you could possibly imagine, and butchers, bakers and cheesemongers whose exquisite foods made a person dance with delight when they ate them.


Everything was perfect – except for the misty Marshlands to the north which, according to legend, were home to the monstrous Ickabog. Anyone sensible knew that the Ickabog was just a myth, to scare children into behaving. But the funny thing about myths is that sometimes they take on a life of their own.

NEW YORK TIMES
 BESTSELLER


WINNER OF THE BOOKER PRIZE


The Testaments
 is a modern masterpiece, a powerful novel that can be read on its own or as a companion to Margaret Atwood's classic, 
The Handmaid's Tale
.


More than fifteen years after the events of 
The Handmaid's Tale, 
the theocratic regime of the Republic of Gilead maintains its grip on power, but there are signs it is beginning to rot from within. At this crucial moment, the lives of three radically different women converge, with potentially explosive results.


Two have grown up as part of the first generation to come of age in the new order. The testimonies of these two young women are joined by a third: Aunt Lydia. Her complex past and uncertain future unfold in surprising and pivotal ways.


With 
The Testaments, 
Margaret Atwood opens up the innermost workings of Gilead, as each woman is forced to come to terms with who she is, and how far she will go for what she believes.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_45478.jpg,Margaret Atwood,Random House,2020,448,Tiếng Anh,Contemporary Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/the-testaments-a-novel-handmaid-s-tale.html

""An empowering story about body confidence."" - The Observer

""Engaging... A powerful antidote to casting shade."" - The Sunday Times


I'm going to tell you the word that ruins my entire life: BIG. Because my name is Jemima Small. But I am exactly the opposite.


Jemima Small is funny and smart. She knows a lot of things. Like the fact that she's made of 206 bones, over 600 muscles and trillions of cells.

A stunningly presented modern-day fable from world-renowned talent Oliver Jeffers.


“In an age of exquisite picture books, this is possibly the most beautiful of the year…”
 
Imogen Carter / The Observer New Review


“Visually stunning and original”
Daily Mail


There was once a man who believed he owned everything and set out to survey what was his.


“You are mine,” Fausto said to the flower, the sheep and the mountain, and they bowed before him. But they were not enough for Fausto, so he conquered a boat and set out to sea…

The Little Book Of Otter Philosophy (The Little Animal Philosophy Books),"The Little Book Of Otter Philosophy (The Little Animal Philosophy Books)


Otters are some of the most delightful animals on the planet.


These long, lean, furry creatures embody pure joy in so many ways – they live for napping, playing, making friends and eating, and forget about the rest. Pretty inspiring, right?


In a world that can often seem divided, lonely, and just plain cruel, the otter reminds us of what’s important in life.


What other animal:


- Holds hands with their friends whilst napping so they don’t float away?

- Communicates in a flurry of whistles, chirps, chuckles, clicks and coos?

- Builds a waterslide on a daily basis?

- Befriends other species, just because?

- Eats food off their tummy while floating peacefully with their pals?


These intelligent, adorable, water-dwelling mammals have a lot to teach us about the way we live. So, kick back, grab a pal, dive in and reconnect with your playful side, just like you otter!",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_44457.jpg,Jennifer McCartney,Usborne,2019,160,Tiếng Anh,Philosophy,https://www.fahasa.com/the-little-book-of-otter-philosophy-the-little-animal-philosophy-books.html
Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder,"Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder


'Really made me think about how I think' - Mohsin Hamid, author of 
Exit West


Tough times don't last. Tough people do.


In 
The Black Swan, 
Taleb showed us that highly improbable and unpredictable events underlie almost everything about our world. Here Taleb stands uncer­tainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resil­ient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better.


Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, many things in life benefit from stress, disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls antifragile are things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.


Antifragile 
is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world. Erudite, witty, and iconoclastic, Taleb's message is revolutionary: the antifragile, and only the antifragile, will make it.

Leadership Is Language: The Hidden Power Of What You Say And What You Don't,"Leadership Is Language: The Hidden Power Of What You Say And What You Don't


'Full of compelling advice on how to lead more effectively by choosing your words more wisely' - ADAM GRANT, author of 
Originals
 and 
Give and Take


FT
 Book of the Month


Your words matter more than you think


Most of us use the language we inherited from a time when workers worked with their hands and managers worked with their heads. Today, your people do much more than simply follow orders. They contribute to performance and solve problems, and it's time we updated our language to reflect that.


In 
Leadership Is Language
, former US Navy captain L. David Marquet offers a radical playbook to empower your people and put your team on a path to continuous improvement. The framework will help you achieve the right balance between deliberation and action, and take bold risks without endangering your mission. Among other things, you'll learn:


· How to avoid the seven common sins of questioning, from binary questions (should we do A or B?) to self-affirming questions (B is the better option, right?)


· Why you should vote first, then discuss, when deciding on a plan with your team, rather than voting after discussion


· Why it's better to give your people information instead of instructions


As a submarine captain, Marquet used his counterintuitive model of leadership to turn the worst-performing submarine crew into the best-performing one in the fleet, a story he recounted in his bestselling book 
Turn the Ship Around!
 Now, in 
Leadership Is Language
, he draws on a wide range of examples, from the 2017 Oscars Best Picture mishap to the tragic sinking of the SS El Faro, to show you exactly how the words you use (and don't use) impact how your people contribute.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_42519.jpg,L David Marquet,Penguin Books,2020,352,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/leadership-is-language-the-hidden-power-of-what-you-say-and-what-you-don-t.html

The Physics Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained,"The Physics Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained


Explore the laws and theories of physics in this accessible introduction to the forces that shape our Universe, our planet, and our everyday lives.


Using a bold, graphic-led approach 
The Physics Book 
sets out more than 80 key concepts and discoveries that have defined the subject and influenced our technology since the beginning of time. With the focus firmly on unpicking the thought behind each theory - as well as exploring when and how each idea and breakthrough came about - seven themed chapters examine the history and developments in areas such as energy and matter, and electricity and magnetism, as well as quantum, nuclear, and particle physics.


Eureka moments abound: from Pythagoras's observations of the pleasing harmonies created by vibrating strings, and Galileo's experiments with spheres, to Isaac Newton's apple and his conclusions about gravity and the laws of motion. You'll also learn about Albert Einstein's insights into relativity; how the accidental discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation confirmed the Big Bang theory; the search for the Higgs boson particle; and why most of our Universe is missing. If you've ever wondered exactly how physicists formulated - and proved - these abstract concepts,

What It Takes: Lessons In The Pursuit Of Excellence,"What It Takes: Lessons In The Pursuit Of Excellence


NEW YORK TIMES 
BESTSELLER


From Blackstone chairman, CEO, and co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman, a long-awaited book that uses impactful episodes from Schwarzman's life to show readers how to build, transform, and lead thriving organizations. Whether you are a student, entrepreneur, philanthropist, executive, or simply someone looking for ways to maximize your potential, the same lessons apply.


People know who Stephen Schwarzman is--at least they think they do. He's the man who took $400,000 and co-founded Blackstone, the investment firm that manages over $500 billion (as of January 2019). He's the CEO whose views are sought by heads of state. He's the billionaire philanthropist who founded Schwarzman Scholars, this century's version of the Rhodes Scholarship, in China. But behind these achievements is a man who has spent his life learning and reflecting on what it takes to achieve excellence, make an impact, and live a life of consequence.


Folding handkerchiefs in his father's linen shop, Schwarzman dreamed of a larger life, filled with purpose and adventure. His grades and athleticism got him into Yale. After starting his career in finance with a short stint at a financial firm called DLJ, Schwarzman began working at Lehman Brothers where he ascended to run the mergers and acquisitions practice. He eventually partnered with his mentor and friend Pete Peterson to found Blackstone, vowing to create a new and different kind of financial institution.


Building Blackstone into the leading global financial institution it is today didn't come easy. Schwarzman focused intensely on culture, hiring great talent, and establishing processes that allow the firm to systematically analyze and evaluate risk. Schwarzman's simple mantra ""don't lose money"" has helped Blackstone become a leading private equity and real estate investor, and manager of alternative assets for institutional investors globally. Both he and the firm are known for the rigor of their investment process, their innovative approach to deal making, the diversification of their business lines, and a conviction to be the best at everything they do.


Schwarzman is also an active philanthropist, having given away more than a billion dollars. In philanthropy, as in business, he is drawn to situations where his capital and energy can be applied to drive transformative solutions and change paradigms, notably in education. He uses the skills learned over a lifetime in finance to design, establish, and support impactful and innovative organizations and initiatives. His gifts have ranged from creating a new College of Computing at MIT for the study of artificial intelligence, to establishing a first-of-its-kind student and performing arts center at Yale, to enabling the renovation of the iconic New York Public Library, to founding the Schwarzman Scholars fellowship program at Tsinghua University in Beijing--the single largest philanthropic effort in China's history from international donors.


Schwarzman's story is an empowering, entertaining, and informative guide for anyone striving for greater personal impact. From deal making to investing, leadership to entrepreneurship, philanthropy to diplomacy, Schwarzman has lessons for how to think about ambition and scale, risk and opportunities, and how to achieve success through the relentless pursuit of excellence. Schwarzman not only offers readers a thoughtful reflection on all his own experiences, but in doing so provides a practical blueprint for success.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_42188.jpg,Stephen A Schwarzman,Simon And Schuster,2019,384,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Business & Industry,https://www.fahasa.com/what-it-takes-lessons-in-the-pursuit-of-excellence.html

Sweeping Up The Heart,"Sweeping Up The Heart


From two-time Newbery Honor and 
New York Times–
bestselling author Kevin Henkes, this timeless novel about loss, loneliness, and friendship tells the story of the spring break that changes seventh-grader Amelia Albright’s life forever. 
This middle grade novel is an excellent choice for tween readers in grades 5 to 6, especially during homeschooling. It’s a fun way to keep your child entertained and engaged while not in the classroom.


Amelia Albright dreams about going to Florida for spring break like everyone else in her class, but her father—a cranky and stubborn English professor—has decided Florida is too much adventure.


Now Amelia is stuck at home with him and her babysitter, the beloved Mrs. O’Brien. The week ahead promises to be boring, until Amelia meets Casey at her neighborhood art studio. Amelia has never been friends with a boy before, and the experience is both fraught and thrilling. When Casey claims to see the spirit of Amelia’s mother (who died ten years before), the pair embarks on an altogether different journey in their attempt to find her.


Using crisp, lyrical, literary writing and moments of humor and truth, award-winning author Kevin Henkes deftly captures how it feels to be almost thirteen.


With themes of family, death, grief, creativity, and loyalty, 
Sweeping Up the Heart 
is for readers of Kate DiCamillo, Rebecca Stead, Lauren Wolk, Kimberly Brubaker Bradley, and Pam Muñoz Ryan.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_41960.jpg,Kevin Henkes,HarperCollins Publishers,2020,192,Tiếng Anh,Family,https://www.fahasa.com/sweeping-up-the-heart-291603.html

The Tiny Seed (World Of Eric Carle),"The Tiny Seed (World Of Eric Carle)


In autumn, a strong wind blows flower seeds high in the air and carries them far across the land. One by one, many of the seeds are lost -- burned by the sun, fallen into the ocean, eaten by a bird. But some survive the long winter and, come spring, sprout into plants, facing new dangers -- trampled by playing children, picked as a gift for a friend. Soon only the tiniest seed remains, growing into a giant flower and, when autumn returns, sending its own seeds into the wind to start the process over again.

Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed To Reverse Global Warming,"Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed To Reverse Global Warming


One hundred practical measures for the most comprehensive plan to reduce greenhouse gases.


In 
Drawdown
, renowned environmentalist Paul Hawken has assembled a team of over 200 scholars, scientists, policymakers, business leaders, and activists to illustrate the hundred most substantive solutions to combat climate change that together will not only slow down the growth of carbon emissions, but reverse them altogether. The book analyzes how and when humanity can reach climate drawdown, the point at which greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere begin to decline on a year-to-year basis, by mapping and modeling how we can scale those hundred technologies over the next thirty years. Printed on recycled paper, Drawdown the book, will be one of three centerpieces to Project Drawdown, which will also feature an open-source database and an interactive digital platform that together describe how these solutions can be scaled globally across continents and across many different ways of life.


These are all no regrets approaches-actions that regardless of their climate value have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. They improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health. Together they will mobilise society into taking the climate change conversation from problem definition to problem solving, from fear and apathy to collaboration and regeneration.

""I haven't read anything that has moved me this much since

 --Jennifer Niven, author of
 All the Bright Places


A space-obsessed boy and his dog, Carl Sagan, take a journey toward family, love, hope, and awe in this funny and moving novel for fans of 
Counting by 7s
, 
Walk Two Moons, and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time
.


11-year-old Alex Petroski loves space and rockets, his mom, his brother, and his dog Carl Sagan--named for his hero, the real-life astronomer. All he wants is to launch his golden iPod into space the way Carl Sagan (the man, not the dog) launched his Golden Record on the Voyager spacecraft in 1977. From Colorado to New Mexico, Las Vegas to L.A., Alex records a journey on his iPod to show other lifeforms what life on earth, 
his
 earth, is like. But his destination keeps changing. And the funny, lost, remarkable people he meets along the way can only partially prepare him for the secrets he'll uncover--from the truth about his long-dead dad to the fact that, for a kid with a troubled mom and a mostly not-around brother, he has way more family than he ever knew.


Jack Cheng's debut is full of joy, optimism, determination, and unbelievable heart. To read the first page is to fall in love with Alex and his view of our big, beautiful, complicated world. To read the last is to know he and his story will stay with you a long, long time.

NEW YORK TIMES 
BESTSELLER 
• 
In
 Sapiens, 
he explored our past. In 
Homo Deus, 
he looked to our future
. 
Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today’s most pressing issues.


“Fascinating . . . a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the twenty-first century.”—Bill Gates, 
The New York Times Book Review


NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY 
FINANCIAL TIMES 
AND 
PAMELA PAUL, KQED 


How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?


Yuval Noah Harari’s 
21 Lessons for the 21st Century
 is a probing and visionary investigation into today’s most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.


In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?


Harari’s unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power. Presenting complex contemporary challenges clearly and accessibly, 
21 Lessons for the 21st Century
 is essential reading.


“If there were such a thing as a required instruction manual for politicians and thought leaders, Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s 
21 Lessons for the 21st Century
 would deserve serious consideration. In this collection of provocative essays, Harari . . . tackles a daunting array of issues, endeavoring to answer a persistent question: ‘What is happening in the world today, and what is the deep meaning of these events?’”—

"Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, And The Last Trial Of Harper Lee","Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, And The Last Trial Of Harper Lee


New York Times Best Seller   “Compelling . . . at once a true-crime thriller, courtroom drama, and miniature biography of Harper Lee. If To Kill a Mockingbird was one of your favorite books growing up, you should add Furious Hours to your reading list today.” — Southern Living   Reverend Willie Maxwell was a rural preacher accused of murdering five of his family members for insurance money in the 1970s. With the help of a savvy lawyer, he escaped justice for years until a relative shot him dead at the funeral of his last victim. Despite hundreds of witnesses, Maxwell’s murderer was acquitted—thanks to the same attorney who had previously defended the Reverend.   Sitting in the audience during the vigilante’s trial was Harper Lee, who had traveled from New York City to her native Alabama with the idea of writing her own In Cold Blood, the true-crime classic she had helped her friend Truman Capote research seventeen years earlier. Lee spent a year in town reporting, and many more years working on her own version of the case.  Now Casey Cep brings this story to life, from the shocking murders to the courtroom drama to the racial politics of the Deep South. At the same time, she offers a deeply moving portrait of one of the country’s most beloved writers and her struggle with fame, success, and the mystery of artistic creativity.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_39330.jpg,Casey Cep,Random House,2019,336,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Literary,https://www.fahasa.com/furious-hours-murder-fraud-and-the-last-trial-of-harper-lee.html

KLUTZ: Air Power: Rocket Science Made Simple,"KLUTZ: Air Power: Rocket Science Made Simple


Build four balloon-powered vehicles and learn what makes them move.


Some people say ""it's not rocket science"" when something is easy to understand. Around here, we think that saying is kind of strange. Rocket science isn't difficult. In fact, it's as easy as blowing up a balloon and letting go.


Air Power
 delivers rocket-propelled fun in the form of four easy-to-assemble vehicles. Young speed demons can race a sturdy, cardstock hot rod across the floor, glide a hovercraft over the dining room table, take flight with a helicopter, and blast off with an only-from-Klutz balloon-powered rocket. Tweaking, tinkering, and experimenting are guaranteed.


Inside the book, super-clear building instructions and scientific explanations make hands-on experience with rocketry and jet propulsion as easy as child's play. Plenty of real-world examples show that the principles demonstrated here aren't only rad, they're relevant. Altogether, 
Air Power
 brings a breath - make that a blast - of fresh air to Isaac Newton's famous Laws of Motion. Turns out rocket science is way too much fun to leave to the rocket scientists.


Comes with:
 4 plastic parts (2 mouthpieces, thrust vent for hovercraft, blast cap), straws for blast pipes, 8 wheels, 4 axles, one hot-rod body, one hovercraft body, rocket fins and tube, helicopter blade assembly, three 9"" balloons, two 6"" balloons, sticker sheet.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_39286.jpg,Pat Murphy,Scholastic,2019,48,Tiếng Anh,Hobbies & Games,https://www.fahasa.com/klutz-air-power-rocket-science-made-simple.html

Avery tracks down all of the guys she's ever dated, and uses that information, along with the thoughts of her friends, family, and even teachers to compile a total account of her dating history.

How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life Of The Brain,"How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life Of The Brain


'
How Emotions Are Made
 did what all great books do. It took a subject I thought I understood and turned my understanding upside down' - Malcolm Gladwell


When you feel anxious, angry, happy, or surprised, what's really going on inside of you?


Many scientists believe that emotions come from a specific part of the brain, triggered by the world around us. The thrill of seeing an old friend, the fear of losing someone we love - each of these sensations seems to arise automatically and uncontrollably from within us, finding expression on our faces and in our behaviour, carrying us away with the experience.


This understanding of emotion has been around since Plato. But what if it is wrong? In 
How Emotions Are Made
, pioneering psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett draws on the latest scientific evidence to reveal that our common-sense ideas about emotions are dramatically, even dangerously, out of date - and that we have been paying the price. Emotions aren't universally pre-programmed in our brains and bodies; rather they are psychological experiences that each of us constructs based on our unique personal history, physiology and environment.


This new view of emotions has serious implications: when judges issue lesser sentences for crimes of passion, when police officers fire at threatening suspects, or when doctors choose between one diagnosis and another, they're all, in some way, relying on the ancient assumption that emotions are hardwired into our brains and bodies. Revising that conception of emotion isn't just good science, Barrett shows; it's vital to our well-being and the health of society itself.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_38787.jpg,Lisa Feldman Barrett,Macmillan Publishers,2018,448,Tiếng Anh,Psychology,https://www.fahasa.com/how-emotions-are-made-the-secret-life-of-the-brain.html

The Levelling: What's Next After Globalization,"The Levelling: What's Next After Globalization


A brilliant analysis of the transition in world economics, finance, and power as the era of globalization ends and gives way to new power centers and institutions.


The world is at a turning point similar to the fall of communism. Then, many focused on the collapse itself, and failed to see that a bigger trend, globalization, was about to take hold. The benefits of globalization--through the freer flow of money, people, ideas, and trade--have been many. But rather than a world that is flat, what has emerged is one of jagged peaks and rough, deep valleys characterized by wealth inequality, indebtedness, political recession, and imbalances across the world's economies.


These peaks and valleys are undergoing what Michael O'Sullivan calls ""the levelling""--a major transition in world economics, finance, and power. What's next is a levelling-out of wealth between poor and rich countries, of power between nations and regions, of political accountability from elites to the people, and of institutional power away from central banks and defunct twentieth-century institutions such as the WTO and the IMF.


O'Sullivan then moves to ways we can develop new, pragmatic solutions to such critical problems as political discontent, stunted economic growth, the productive functioning of finance, and political-economic structures that serve broader needs.


The Levelling 
comes at a crucial time in the rise and fall of nations. It has special importance for the US as its place in the world undergoes radical change--the ebbing of influence, profound questions over its economic model, societal decay, and the turmoil of public life.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_38242.jpg,Michael O'Sullivan,Hachette Book Group,2019,368,Tiếng Anh,Economics,https://www.fahasa.com/the-levelling-what-s-next-after-globalization.html

But all that changes when tragedy strikes and Maxim inherits his family's noble title, wealth, and estates, and all the responsibility that entails. It's a role he's not prepared for and one that he struggles to face.


But his biggest challenge is fighting his desire for an unexpected, enigmatic young woman who's recently arrived in England, possessing little more than a dangerous and troublesome past. Reticent, beautiful, and musically gifted, she's an alluring mystery, and Maxim's longing for her deepens into a passion that he's never experienced and dares not name. Just who is Alessia Demachi? Can Maxim protect her from the malevolence that threatens her? And what will she do when she learns that he's been hiding secrets of his own?

Reasons to Stay Alive

The societies we live in are increasingly making our minds ill, making it feel as though the way we live is engineered to make us unhappy. When Matt Haig developed panic disorder, anxiety, and depression as an adult, it took him a long time to work out the ways the external world could impact his mental health in both positive and negative ways. 
Notes on a Nervous Planet 
collects his observations, taking a look at how the various social, commercial and technological ""advancements"" that have created the world we now live in can actually hinder our happiness. Haig examines everything from broader phenomena like inequality, social media, and the news; to things closer to our daily lives, like how we sleep, how we exercise, and even the distinction we draw between our minds and our bodies.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_37602.jpg,Matt Haig,Penguin Books,2019,304,Tiếng Anh,"Assertiveness, Motivation & Self-esteem",https://www.fahasa.com/notes-on-a-nervous-planet.html

From My Heart: The Autobiography,"From My Heart: The Autobiography


'While I don’t have any choice in how long I have to live, I do have a choice in how I spend the time I have. And I’ve chosen not to spend it constantly stressing about cancer. I’ve chosen to enjoy the little things. I’ve chosen to laugh. And I’ve chosen to look back on my life and thank God for it.'


In March 2017, Linda Nolan was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer and was given the terrible news that, while it was treatable, it was not curable. Her first thought was to worry about her family, who were still grieving the loss of their sister Bernie. Her second was, ‘But I’m alive and I’m going to fight it.’


In 
From My Heart
, Linda writes honestly about growing up in her big Irish family and finding fame with her sisters in The Nolans and reveals the shocking family secrets and feuds that threatened to tear them apart. She also describes her original battle with breast cancer and how the death of her husband left her deeply depressed, to the point of feeling suicidal. Just as she’d learned to embrace life again, and even to start dating, the cancer came back . . . In this warm, brave and funny memoir, Linda shows that it’s never too late to learn what really matters.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_36834.jpg,Linda Nolan,Macmillan Publishers,2019,320,Tiếng Anh,Memoirs,https://www.fahasa.com/from-my-heart-the-autobiography.html
"The Complete Turtletrader: The Legend, The Lessons, The Results","The Complete Turtletrader: The Legend, The Lessons, The Results


This is the true story behind Wall Street legend Richard Dennis, his disciples, the Turtles, and the trading techniques that made them millionaires.


What happens when ordinary people are taught a system to make extraordinary money? Richard Dennis made a fortune on Wall Street by investing according to a few simple rules. Convinced that great trading was a skill that could be taught to anyone, he made a bet with his partner and ran a classified ad in the 
Wall Street Journal
 looking for novices to train. His recruits, later known as the Turtles, had anything but traditional Wall Street backgrounds; they included a professional blackjack player, a pianist, and a fantasy game designer. For two weeks, Dennis taught them his investment rules and philosophy, and set them loose to start trading, each with a million dollars of 
his
 money. By the time the experiment ended, Dennis had made a hundred million dollars from his Turtles and created one killer Wall Street legend.


In 
The Complete Turtle Trader
, Michael W. Covel, bestselling author of 
Trend Following
 and managing editor of TurtleTrader.com, the leading website on the Turtles, tells their riveting story with the first ever on the record interviews with individual Turtles. He describes how Dennis interviewed and selected his students, details their education and experiences while working for him, and breaks down the Turtle system and rules in full. He reveals how they made astounding fortunes, and follows their lives from the original experiment to the present day. Some have grown even wealthier than ever, and include some of today's top hedge fund managers. Equally important are those who passed along their approach to a second generation of Turtles, proving that the Turtles' system truly is reproducible, and that anyone with the discipline and the desire to succeed can do as well as—or even better than—Wall Street's top hedge fund wizards.


In an era full of slapdash investing advice and promises of hot stock tips for ""the next big thing,"" as popularized by pundits like Jim Cramer of 
Mad Money
, the easy-to-follow objective rules of the TurtleTrader stand out as a sound guide for truly making the most out of your money. These rules worked—and still work today—for the Turtles, and any other investor with the desire and commitment to learn from one of the greatest investing stories of all time.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_36531.jpg,Michael W Covel,HarperCollins Publishers,2009,288,Tiếng Anh,Personal Finance,https://www.fahasa.com/the-complete-turtletrader-the-legend-the-lessons-the-results.html
Invested,"Invested


In this essential handbook—a blend of 
Rich Dad, Poor Dad
 and 
The Happiness Project
—the co-host of the wildly popular InvestED podcast shares her yearlong journey learning to invest, as taught to her by her father, investor and bestselling author Phil Town.


Growing up, the words finance, savings, and portfolio made Danielle Town’s eyes glaze over, and the thought of stocks and financial statements shut down her brain. The daughter of a successful investor and bestselling financial author of 
Rule #1
, Phil Town, she spent most of her adult life avoiding investing—until she realized that her time-consuming career as lawyer was making her feel anything but in control of her life or her money. Determined to regain her freedom, vote for her values with her money, and deal with her fear of the unpredictable stock market, she turned to her father, Phil, to help her take charge of her life and her future through Warren Buffett-style value investing. Over the course of a year, Danielle went from avoiding everything to do with the financial industrial complex to knowing exactly how and when to invest in wonderful companies.


In
 Invested
, Danielle shows you how to do the same: how to take command of your own life and finances by choosing companies with missions that match your values, using the same gold standard strategies that have catapulted Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to the top of the 
Forbes
 400. Avoiding complex math and obsolete financial models, she turns her father’s investing knowledge into twelve easy-to understand lessons.


In each chapter, Danielle examines the investment strategies she mastered as her increasing know-how deepens the trust between her and her father. Throughout, she streamlines the process of making wise financial decisions and shows you just how easy—and profitable—investing can be.


Capturing a warm, charming, and down-to-earth give and take between a headstrong daughter and her mostly patient dad, 
Invested 
makes the complex world of investing simple, straightforward, and approachable, and will help you formulate your own investment plan—and foster the confidence to put it into action.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_36487.jpg,"Danielle Town, Phil Town",HarperCollins Publishers,2019,336,Tiếng Anh,Personal Finance,https://www.fahasa.com/invested.html
The Enemy Of The People: A Dangerous Time To Tell The Truth In America,"The Enemy Of The People: A Dangerous Time To Tell The Truth In America


A 
New York Times 
bestseller.


From CNN’s veteran Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta, an explosive, first-hand account of the dangers he faces reporting on the current White House while fighting on the front lines in President Trump’s war on truth, featuring new material exclusive to the paperback edition. 


In Mr. Trump’s campaign against what he calls “Fake News,” CNN Chief White House Correspondent, Jim Acosta, is public enemy number one. From the moment Mr. Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, he has attacked the media, calling journalists “the enemy of the people.”


Acosta presents a damning examination of bureaucratic dysfunction, deception, and the unprecedented threat the rhetoric Mr. Trump is directing has on our democracy. When the leader of the free world incites hate and violence, Acosta doesn’t back down, and he urges his fellow citizens to do the same.


At Mr. Trump’s most hated network, CNN, Acosta offers a never-before-reported account of what it’s like to be the President’s most hated correspondent. Acosta goes head-to-head with the White House, even after Trump supporters have threatened his life with words as well as physical violence.


From the hazy denials and accusations meant to discredit the Mueller investigation, to the president’s scurrilous tweets, Jim Acosta is in the eye of the storm while reporting live to millions of people across the world. After spending hundreds of hours with the revolving door of White House personnel, Acosta paints portraits of the personalities of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Hope Hicks, Jared Kushner and more. Acosta is tenacious and unyielding in his public battle to preserve the First Amendment and #RealNews.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_36477.jpg,Jim Acosta,HarperCollins Publishers,2019,368,Tiếng Anh,Politics & Government,https://www.fahasa.com/the-enemy-of-the-people-a-dangerous-time-to-tell-the-truth-in-america.html

""A tour de force – a gripping, twisting, furiously clever read that asks all the right questions, and keeps you guessing until the very end. I loved it."" 
―
 
Ruth Ware


""Haunting. Mesmerizing. Unforgettable."" ― Gillian Flynn


In the summer of 1999, Kit and Laura travel to a festival in Cornwall to see a total eclipse of the sun. Kit is an eclipse chaser; Laura has never seen one before. Young and in love, they are certain this will be the first of many they’ll share.


But in the hushed moments after the shadow passes, Laura interrupts a man and a woman. She knows that she saw something terrible. The man denies it. It is her word against his.


The victim seems grateful. Months later, she turns up on their doorstep like a lonely stray. But as her gratitude takes a twisted turn, Laura begins to wonder―did she trust the wrong person?


15 years later, Kit and Laura married are living under new names and completely off the digital grid: no Facebook, only rudimentary cell phones, not in any directories. But as the truth catches up to them, they realize they can no longer keep the past in the past.

What Were The Negro Leagues? (What Was?),"What Were The Negro Leagues? (What Was?)


In America during the early twentieth century, no part was safe from segregation, not even the country's national pastime, baseball. Despite their exodus from the Major Leagues because of the colour of their skin, African American men still found a way to participate in the sport they loved. Author Varian Johnson shines a spotlight on the players, coaches, owners, and teams that dominated the Negro Leagues during the 1930s and 40s. Readers will learn about how phenomenal players like Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, and of course, Jackie Robinson greatly changed the sport of baseball.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_35558.jpg,Varian Johnson,Penguin Books,2020,112,Tiếng Anh,People & Places,https://www.fahasa.com/what-were-the-negro-leagues-what-was.html

NY Journal of Books


Having defeated the monstrous threat that nearly destroyed the peculiar world, Jacob Portman is back where his story began, in Florida. Except now Miss Peregrine, Emma, and their peculiar friends are with him, and doing their best to blend in. But carefree days of beach visits and normalling lessons are soon interrupted by a discovery—a subterranean bunker that belonged to Jacob’s grandfather, Abe.


Clues to Abe’s double-life as a peculiar operative start to emerge, secrets long hidden in plain sight. And Jacob begins to learn about the dangerous legacy he has inherited—truths that were part of him long before he walked into Miss Peregrine’s time loop.


Now, the stakes are higher than ever as Jacob and his friends are thrust into the untamed landscape of American peculiardom—a world with few ymbrynes, or rules—that none of them understand. New wonders, and dangers, await in this brilliant next chapter for Miss Peregrine’s peculiar children.

'The powerful story of a woman who was ahead of her time' Mishal Husain, presenter at BBC World News, BBC Weekend News, BBC News at Six, Radio 4


A beautiful woman in winged eyeliner and a low-cut top lies on a bed urging her favourite cricketer to win the next match. In another post, she pouts at the camera from a hot tub. She posts a selfie with a cleric, wearing his cap at a jaunty angle. Her posts are viewed millions of times and the comments beneath them are full of hate. As her notoriety grows, the comments made about her on national talk shows are just as vitriolic. They call her Pakistan's Kim Kardashian, they say she'll do anything for attention. When she's murdered, they're transfixed by the footage of her body.


Drawing on interviews and in-depth research, Sanam Maher pieces together Qandeel's life from the village where she grew up in the backwaters of rural Pakistan, to her stint in a women's shelter after escaping her marriage, to her incarnation as a social media sensation and the Muslim world's most unlikely feminist icon.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_35106.jpg,Sanam Maher,Macmillan Publishers,2019,336,Tiếng Anh,True Crime,https://www.fahasa.com/a-woman-like-her-the-short-life-of-qandeel-baloch.html

The Social CEO: How Social Media Can Make You A Stronger Leader,"The Social CEO: How Social Media Can Make You A Stronger Leader


There remains a huge gulf in understanding by many leaders of what some are calling the Social Age - huge changes going on in society, enabling anyone with a smartphone to sign up to a social network and comment on anything and everything. Despite this revolution, which has been embraced by the masses, it is the people at the top of organizations who have been slowest to understand and adapt to it.


While business leaders may feel that it's enough to hire social media managers and amend their marketing strategies, Damian Corbet shows why organizations need to do more to succeed in the Social Age - why CEOs need to 'get social' to survive.


The Social CEO
 sets out to educate and inspire senior leaders to embrace the Social Age, teaching them the hows and whys of utilising social media in order to make them stronger leaders. Social CEOs can effectively encourage engagement from their employees as well as other stakeholders and customers; they're better able to communicate their organization's objectives and values, gauge the climate in which they operate and improve their brand image.


Offering invaluable contributions from industry-recognised experts in social business, 
The Social CEO
 explores the many aspects of leading in the Social Age, such as storytelling, personal branding, managing risk and public relations. With chapters also written by practising 'social CEOs' working across a variety of sectors, from healthcare to sport, the book provides a wealth of insight into how social media can be used to gain a competitive advantage.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_35100.jpg,Damian Corbet,Macmillan Publishers,2019,312,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/the-social-ceo-how-social-media-can-make-you-a-stronger-leader.html

It's been a year since Leo Stanhope lost the woman he loved, and came closing to losing his own life. Now, more than ever, he is determined to keep his head down and stay safe, without risking those he holds dear. But Leo's hopes for peace and security are shattered when the police unexpectedly arrive at his lodgings: a woman has been found murdered at a club for anarchists, and Leo's address is in her purse. When Leo is taken to the club by the police, he is shocked to discover there a man from his past, a man who knows Leo's birth identity. And if Leo does not provide him with an alibi for the night of the woman's killing, he is going to share this information with the authorities.

Escaping her failing marriage, Grace has returned to Pondicherry to cremate her mother. Once there, she finds herself heir to an unexpected inheritance. First, there is the strange pink house, blue-shuttered, out on a spit of the wild beach, haunted by the rattle of fishermen in their catamarans. And then there is the sister she never knew she had: Lucia, who has spent her life in a residential facility.


Soon Grace sets up a new and precarious life in this lush, melancholy wilderness, with Lucia, the village housekeeper Mallika, the drily witty Auntie Kavitha and an ever-multiplying litter of puppies. Here in Paramankeni, with its vacant bus stops colonised by flying foxes, its temples and step-wells shielded by canopies of teak and tamarind, where every dusk the fishermen line the beach smoking and mending their nets, Grace feels that she has come to the very end of the world. But Grace's attempts to play house prove first a struggle, then a strain, as she discovers the chaos, tenderness, fury and bewilderment of life with Lucia.

"The Change: Women, Ageing And The Menopause","The Change: Women, Ageing And The Menopause


The seminal, ground-breaking and controversial feminist text on the menopause, revised and updated


When 
The Change
 was published in 1991, 'menopause' was a word of fear. Then, as now, expensive magazines advertised even more expensive anti-ageing preparations, none of which worked. Big pharma was pushing replacement hormones, but doctors were dragging their feet. Some women told horror stories of their experiences with replacement hormones; others called them lifesavers.


Nobody knew why some women went through this change of life without difficulty. What was working for them, when other women were tormented almost to madness?


It seemed that we were close to an answer to that question, but that was before large-scale studies revealed that the protective effects of hormone replacement had been vastly exaggerated; given the perceived increase in the risk of life-threatening disease, the studies had to be called off.


Now more than ever, amid the clamour of online chatrooms and promotions for a vast array of alternative therapies, the individual woman has to manage her passage through menopause for herself. In

Discover the 13 powerful principles behind every great success story


The timeless bestseller setting out Hills’s formula for money-making success


Napoleon Hill, America's most beloved motivational author, devoted 25 years to finding out how the wealthy became that way. After interviewing over 500 of the most affluent men and women of his time, he uncovered the secret to great wealth based on the notion that if we can learn to think like the rich, we can start to behave like them. By understanding and applying the thirteen simple steps that constitute Hill's formula, you can achieve your goals, change your life and join the ranks of the rich and successful.


Hill’s principles include Faith (true belief you can achieve your goal through visualisation), Autosuggestion (influencing the subconscious mind) and Decision (overcoming procrastination and being decisive). Backed by decades of success stories from over 15 million readers, mastering Hill’s principles will help you to become a top-achiever.


In this updated edition, Dr. Arthur R. Pell provides examples of men and women who, in recent times, exemplify the principles that Hill promulgated. With the success stories of top achievers such as Bill Gates and Steven Spielberg, he proves that Hill's philosophies are as valid today as they ever were.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_33540.jpg,Napoleon Hill,Grantham Book Services,2019,320,Tiếng Anh,Personal Finance,https://www.fahasa.com/think-and-grow-rich-vermilion-life-essentials-vermilion-classics.html

'Shoot all the Bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a Mockingbird.'


Atticus Finch gives this advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of this classic novel - a black man charged with attacking a white girl. Through the eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Lee explores the issues of race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s with compassion and humour. She also creates one of the great heroes of literature in their father, whose lone struggle for justice pricks the conscience of a town steeped in prejudice and hypocrisy.

This edition of one of the world’s best-loved books features the original text.

"Surrounded By Idiots: The Four Types Of Human Behaviour (Or, How To Understand Those Who Cannot Be Understood)","Surrounded By Idiots: The Four Types Of Human Behaviour (Or, How To Understand Those Who Cannot Be Understood)


Do you ever think you’re the only one making any sense? Or tried to reason with your partner with disastrous results? Do long, rambling answers drive you crazy? Or does your colleague’s abrasive manner get your back up?


You are not alone. After a disastrous meeting with a highly successful entrepreneur, who was genuinely convinced he was ‘surrounded by idiots’, communication expert and bestselling author, Thomas Erikson dedicated himself to understanding how people function and why we often struggle to connect with certain types of people.


Originally published in Swedish in 2014 as 
Omgiven Av Idioter
, Erikon’s 
Surrounded by Idiots
 is already an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide, of which over 750,000 copies have been sold in Sweden alone. It offers a simple, yet ground-breaking method for assessing the personalities of people we communicate with – in and out of the office – based on four personality types (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), and provides insights into how we can adjust the way(s) we speak and share information.


Erikson will help you understand yourself better, hone communication and social skills, handle conflict with confidence, improve dynamics with your boss and team, and get the best out of the people you deal with and manage. He also shares simple tricks on body language, improving written communication and advice on when to back away or when to push on, and when to speak up or indeed shut up. Packed with ‘aha!’ and ‘oh no!’ moments, 
Surrounded by Idiots
 will help you understand and influence those around you, even people you currently think are beyond all comprehension.


And with a bit of luck you can also be confident that the idiot out there isn’t you!",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_33149.jpg,Thomas Erikson,Grantham Book Services,2019,304,Tiếng Anh,Popular Psychology,https://www.fahasa.com/surrounded-by-idiots-the-four-types-of-human-behaviour-or-how-to-understand-those-who-cannot-be-understood.html

'ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICAN NOVELS EVER WRITTEN'


'Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'


A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel - a black man falsely charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.

Tara Westover and her family grew up preparing for the End of Days but, according to the government, she didn’t exist. She hadn’t been registered for a birth certificate. She had no school records because she’d never set foot in a classroom, and no medical records because her father didn’t believe in hospitals.


As she grew older, her father became more radical and her brother more violent. At sixteen, Tara knew she had to leave home. In doing so she discovered both the transformative power of education, and the price she had to pay for it.

'Finishing this book and then forgetting about it is simply not an option...Unmissable' 
New York Times


At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, the next he was a patient struggling to live.


When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a medical student asking what makes a virtuous and meaningful life into a neurosurgeon working in the core of human identity – the brain – and finally into a patient and a new father.


What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when when life is catastrophically interrupted? What does it mean to have a child as your own life fades away?


Paul Kalanithi died while working on this profoundly moving book, yet his words live on as a guide to us all.

Fifty Shades 
trilogy


London, 2019.
 Life has been easy for Maxim Trevelyan. With his good looks, aristocratic connections, and money, he’s never had to work and he’s rarely slept alone. But all that changes when tragedy strikes and Maxim inherits his family’s noble title, wealth, and estates, and all the responsibility that entails. It’s a role he’s not prepared for and one that he struggles to face.


But his biggest challenge is fighting his desire for an unexpected, enigmatic young woman who’s recently arrived in England, possessing little more than a dangerous and troublesome past. Reticent, beautiful, and musically gifted, she’s an alluring mystery, and Maxim’s longing for her deepens into a passion that he’s never experienced and dares not name. Just who is Alessia Demachi? Can Maxim protect her from the malevolence that threatens her? And what will she do when she learns that he’s been hiding secrets of his own?

Coca Wine: Angelo Mariani's Miraculous Elixir And The Birth Of Modern Advertising,"Coca Wine: Angelo Mariani's Miraculous Elixir And The Birth Of Modern Advertising


A lavishly illustrated history of coca wine and the revolutionary advertising methods that made it a world-wide success


One of the oldest and most potent natural stimulants, the leaves of the coca plant are the organic source from which cocaine is synthesized. Fresh coca leaves and products made from them have verified medicinal and healing properties--and not the same addictive qualities or negative side effects as cocaine. In the late 19th century coca products became hugely successful in Europe and the United States. The most famous was Vin Mariani, a coca-based tonic wine developed by Corsican pharmacist Angelo Mariani (1838-1914). Many celebrities sang its praises, including Pope Benedict XV, Sarah Bernhardt, Thomas Edison, H. G. Wells, and the doctors of Ulysses S Grant, who credited Vin Mariani with giving him the strength to finish his memoirs before his death.


In this full-color illustrated history of coca wine, author Aymon de Lestrange follows Mariani's interest in coca from its medicinal applications as an anesthetic to the creation of the tonic wine. The author explores the botany of coca, how it differs from cocaine, its traditional use in pre-Columbian America, and scientific studies on coca from the 17th through 19th centuries, including from Sigmund Freud, who was a known user.


Looking to the future of coca, the author shows how it has gained renewed interest in the scientific community for its therapeutic and nutritional properties and in the spiritual community, which is seeking to rehabilitate the reputation of coca, the sacred plant of the Incas.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_31156.jpg,Aymon de Lestrange,Simon And Schuster,2019,256,Tiếng Anh,"Mind, Body, Spirit: Meditation & Visualisation",https://www.fahasa.com/coca-wine-angelo-mariani-s-miraculous-elixir-and-the-birth-of-modern-advertising.html

If you want to succeed in business then an MBA programme is the best way to build expertise, knowledge and experience. But an MBA programme at any top school is an enormous investment in time, effort and money. In 
The Visual MBA
, Jason Barron offers a radical solution, explaining all key business school concepts through illustrations.


When Barron started his MBA course, he decided to draw all his notes so that other people could benefit from them. And it's a good thing he did, because research shows that more than 65% of us are visual learners and that our brains process illustrations 60,000 times faster than text.


From Marketing, Ethics and Accounting to Organisational Behaviour, Finance, Operations and Strategy, 
The Visual MBA 
distils the most important principles of an MBA into an accessible, informative and easily-digestible guide.


Jason Barron
 is a product manager and illustrator who helps people realise their creative ideas through visual learning. He spent 516 hours in class and countless hours studying at home completing his MBA.

Malcolm Gladwell is the master of playful yet profound insight. His ability to see underneath the surface of the seemingly mundane taps into a fundamental human impulse: curiosity. From criminology to ketchup, job interviews to dog training, Malcolm Gladwell takes everyday subjects and shows us surprising new ways of looking at them, and the world around us.


Are smart people overrated? What can pit bulls teach us about crime? Why are problems like homelessness easier to solve than to manage? How do we hire when we can't tell who's right for the job? Gladwell explores the minor geniuses, the underdogs and the overlooked, and reveals how everyone and everything contains an intriguing story.

The Picture Of Dorian Gray (Penguin English Library),"The Picture Of Dorian Gray (Penguin English Library)


The Penguin English Library Edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde


'I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me ... Why did you paint it? It will mock me some day - mock me horribly!'


A story of evil, debauchery and scandal, Oscar Wilde's only novel tells of Dorian Gray, a beautiful yet corrupt man. When he wishes that a perfect portrait of himself would bear the signs of ageing in his place, the picture becomes his hideous secret, as it follows Dorian's own downward spiral into cruelty and depravity. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a masterpiece of the evil in men's hearts, and is as controversial and alluring as Wilde himself.

New York Times Book Review


A #1 
New York Times 
bestseller and arguably the best business narrative ever written, 
Barbarians at the Gate

 calls 
Barbarians at the Gate
, “Superlative.” The

Skillful Reading & Writing
 helps teachers prepare their students for academic work in English by teaching not only language systems – grammar and vocabulary – but the necessary skills to engage with topics, texts and discourse with classmates. Students need to know how to do things: how to explain, persuade, outline and argue a thesis, distinguish between important and unimportant information, make transitions, identify cause and effect and more. 
Skillful
 acknowledges that acquiring these skills is not a matter of memorizing facts, but is rather a matter of students noticing them as they read, breaking them down and understanding them through clear explanations, and then practicing those skills in carefully scaffolded writing activities that lead to freer practice. There are also study skills pages within the units which teach students strategies they can use to improve their academic performance and build confidence for ongoing independent learning.


Each unit begins with a stunning visual as well as a discussion point and infographic to orient students and engage them with the unit’s theme. Each unit opening section contains authentic Reuters video, which presents engaging real-world topics to spark ideas and debate. The video can be streamed online or downloaded from the Student’s Resource Center. Unit topics mirror those in

Unshakeable: Your Financial Freedom Playbook,"Unshakeable: Your Financial Freedom Playbook


After interviewing fifty of the world's greatest financial minds and penning the #1 
New York Times
 bestseller 
Money: Master the Game
, Tony Robbins returns with a step-by-step playbook, taking you on a journey to transform your financial life and accelerate your path to financial freedom. No matter your salary, your stage of life, or when you started, this book will provide the tools to help you achieve your financial goals more rapidly than you ever thought possible.


Robbins, who has coached more than fifty million people from 100 countries, is the world's #1 life and business strategist. In this book, he teams up with Peter Mallouk, the only man in history to be ranked the #1 financial advisor in the US for three consecutive years by Barron's. Together they reveal how to become unshakeable--someone who can not only maintain true peace of mind in a world of immense uncertainty, economic volatility, and unprecedented change, but who can profit from the fear that immobilizes so many.


In these pages, through plain English and inspiring stories, you'll discover...


-How to put together a simple, actionable plan that can deliver true financial freedom.


-Strategies from the world's top investors on how to protect yourself and your family and maximize profit from the inevitable crashes and corrections to come.


-How a few simple steps can add a decade or more of additional retirement income by discovering what your 401(k) provider doesn't want you to know.


-The core four principles that most of the world's greatest financial minds utilize so that you can maximize upside and minimize downside.


-The fastest way to put money back in your pocket: uncover the hidden fees and half truths of Wall Street--how the biggest firms keep you overpaying for underperformance.


-Master the mindset of true wealth and experience the fulfillment you deserve today.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_27056.jpg,Tony Robbins,Simon And Schuster,2018,256,Tiếng Anh,"Assertiveness, Motivation & Self-esteem",https://www.fahasa.com/unshakeable-your-financial-freedom-playbook.html

'It is rather awful, Emma thought as she walked across the fields down to the farm, how this business is leading us all into subterfuge and deception, and we can't really tell who is friend and who is enemy . . . ' Emma wakes up one morning to an apocalyptic world. The cosy existence she shares with her grandmother, a famous retired actress, has been shattered: there's no telephone, no radio - and an American warship sits in the harbour. England has withdrawn from the European Common Market and, on the brink of bankruptcy, has decided that salvation lies in a union - political, military and economic - with the United States. Theoretically it is to be an equal partnership, but it soon begins to look like a takeover bid. As the two women piece together clues about the 'friendly' military occupation on their doorstep, family, friends and neighbours come together to resist the interlopers.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_24583.jpg,Daphne Du Maurier,Hachette UK Distribution,2019,336,Tiếng Anh,Science Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/rule-britannia-virago-modern-classics.html

Alexandra Fuller, bestselling author of 
Don't Lets Go to the Dogs Tonight


WINNER of the 2018 PEN Open Book Award




In the tradition of 
Behind the Beautiful Forevers
, this is a masterful, humane work of literary journalism by 
New Yorker
 staff writer Alexis Okeowo - a vivid narrative of Africans who are courageously resisting their continent's wave of fundamentalism.


In 
A Moonless, Starless Sky
 Okeowo weaves together four narratives that form a powerful tapestry of modern Africa: a young couple, kidnap victims of Joseph Kony's LRA; a Mauritanian waging a lonely campaign against modern-day slavery; a women's basketball team flourishing amid war-torn Somalia; and a vigilante who takes up arms against the extremist group Boko Haram. This debut book by one of America's most acclaimed young journalists illuminates the inner lives of ordinary people doing the extraordinary - lives that are too often hidden, underreported, or ignored by the rest of the world.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_24563.jpg,Alexis Okeowo,Hachette UK Distribution,2018,256,Tiếng Anh,Politics & Government,https://www.fahasa.com/a-moonless-starless-sky-ordinary-women-and-men-fighting-extremism-in-africa-274444.html

But soon love is the last thing on Dandy's mind when the news breaks that Lady Lavinia has been found dead, brutally murdered in the middle of her famous knot garden.

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: Illustrated by David Mackintosh (Alma Junior Classics),"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: Illustrated by David Mackintosh (Alma Junior Classics)


From his Baker Street apartment, Sherlock Holmes wields his powers of deduction in pursuit of justice and truth, venturing out into foggy Victorian London accompanied by his faithful sidekick Dr Watson. This classic collection of Holmes tales includes many of the detective's most-loved exploits: Holmes is confronted by a venomous snake in 'The Adventure of the Speckled Band', mystified by a missing thumb in 'The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb' and beguiled by a beautiful opera singer in 'A Scandal in Bohemia', never once losing his famous cool.First appearing separately in the Strand Magazine, these stories were published together in 1892 in a volume that rapidly became one of the most popular Sherlock Holmes collections.

The Culture Code,"The Culture Code


NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The author of The Talent Code unlocks the secrets of highly successful groups and provides tomorrow’s leaders with the tools to build a cohesive, motivated culture.


Where does great culture come from? How do you build and sustain it in your group, or strengthen a culture that needs fixing?


In The Culture Code, Daniel Coyle goes inside some of the world’s most successful organizations—including the U.S. Navy’s SEAL Team Six, IDEO, and the San Antonio Spurs—and reveals what makes them tick. He demystifies the culture-building process by identifying three key skills that generate cohesion and cooperation, and explains how diverse groups learn to function with a single mind. Drawing on examples that range from Internet retailer Zappos to the comedy troupe Upright Citizens Brigade to a daring gang of jewel thieves, Coyle offers specific strategies that trigger learning, spark collaboration, build trust, and drive positive change. Coyle unearths helpful stories of failure that illustrate what not to do, troubleshoots common pitfalls, and shares advice about reforming a toxic culture. Combining leading-edge science, on-the-ground insights from world-class leaders, and practical ideas for action, The Culture Code offers a roadmap for creating an environment where innovation flourishes, problems get solved, and expectations are exceeded.


Culture is not something you are—it’s something you do. The Culture Code puts the power in your hands. No matter the size of your group or your goal, this book can teach you the principles of cultural chemistry that transform individuals into teams that can accomplish amazing things together.


Advance praise for The Culture Code


“I’ve been waiting years for someone to write this book—I’ve built it up in my mind into something extraordinary. But it is even better than I imagined. Daniel Coyle has produced a truly brilliant, mesmerizing read that demystifies the magic of great groups. It blows all other books on culture right out of the water.”—Adam Grant, New York Times bestselling author of Option B, Originals, and Give and Take



“If you want to understand how successful groups work—the signals they transmit, the language they speak, the cues that foster creativity—you won’t find a more essential guide than The Culture Code.”—Charles Duhigg, New York Times bestselling author of The Power of Habit and Smarter Faster Better",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_19780.jpg,Daniel Coyle,Random House,2018,304,Tiếng Anh,Popular Psychology,https://www.fahasa.com/the-culture-code-273440.html

London. 1850. The Great Exhibition is being erected in Hyde Park and among the crowd watching the spectacle two people meet. For Iris, an aspiring artist, it is the encounter of a moment – forgotten seconds later, but for Silas, a collector entranced by the strange and beautiful, that meeting marks a new beginning.


When Iris is asked to model for pre-Raphaelite artist Louis Frost, she agrees on the condition that he will also teach her to paint. Suddenly her world begins to expand, to become a place of art and love.


But Silas has only thought of one thing since their meeting, and his obsession is darkening . . .",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_19782.jpg,Elizabeth Macneal,Macmillan Publishers,2019,336,Tiếng Anh,Romance,https://www.fahasa.com/the-doll-factory.html

'Remarkable
'
 Ian McEwan


Shortlisted for Hearsts' Big Book Award 2018.


Set in 2003 in the sweltering heat of Singapore, Sharlene Teo's 
Ponti 
begins as sixteen-year-olds Szu and Circe develop an intense friendship. For Szu it offers an escape from Amisa, her beautiful, cruel mother – once an actress, and now the silent occupant of a rusty house. But for Circe, their friendship does the opposite, bringing her one step closer to the fascinating, unknowable Amisa.


Seventeen years later, Circe finds herself adrift and alone. And then a project comes up at work, a remake of the cult seventies horror film series ‘Ponti’, the same series that defined Amisa’s short-lived film career. Suddenly Circe is knocked off balance: by memories of the two women she once knew, by guilt, and by a lost friendship that threatens her conscience . . .

The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down: How to be Calm in a Busy World,"The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down: How to be Calm in a Busy World


""Is it the world that's busy, or is it my mind?""


The world moves fast, but that doesn't mean we have to. In this timely guide to mindfulness, Haemin Sunim, a Buddhist monk born in Korea and educated in the United States, offers advice on everything from handling setbacks to dealing with relationships and loved ones, in a beautiful book combining his teachings with calming full-colour illustrations. Even as we speed toward what comes next, Haemin Sunim's messages of encouragement speak directly to the anxieties that have become part of modern life and remind us of the strength and joy that come from slowing down.


Overwhelmingly popular in his native Korea, Haemin Sunim is a spiritual leader whose teachings transcend religions and borders and resonate with people of all ages. With insight and compassion drawn from a life full of change, he shows, as millions have seen, he succeeds at encouraging all of us to notice that when you slow down, the world slows down with you.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_19681.jpg,"Haemin Sunim, Chi-Young Kim",Penguin Books,2019,288,Tiếng Anh,"Mind, Body, Spirit: Meditation & Visualisation",https://www.fahasa.com/the-things-you-can-see-only-when-you-slow-down-how-to-be-calm-in-a-busy-world.html

THE FINANCIAL TIMES 
BOOK OF THE MONTH


Over the past quarter century, Seth Godin has taught and inspired millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, leaders, and fans from all walks of life, via his blog, online courses, lectures, and bestselling books. He is the inventor of countless ideas and phrases that have made their way into mainstream business language, from 
Permission Marketing
 to 
Purple Cow
 to 
Tribes
 to 
The Dip
.


Now, for the first time, Godin offers the core of his marketing wisdom in one accessible, timeless package. At the heart of his approach is a big idea: Great marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems. They don't just make noise; they make the world better. Truly powerful marketing is grounded in empathy, generosity, and emotional labour.


This book teaches you how to identify your smallest viable audience; draw on the right signals and signs to position your offering; build trust and permission with your target market; speak to the narratives your audience tells themselves about status, affiliation, and dominance; spot opportunities to create and release tension; and give people the tools to achieve their goals.


It's time for marketers to stop lying, spamming, and feeling guilty about their work. It's time to stop confusing social media metrics with true connections. It's time to stop wasting money on stolen attention that won't pay off in the long run. 
This is Marketing 
offers a better approach that will still apply for decades to come, no matter how the tactics of marketing continue to evolve.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_19695.jpg,Seth Godin,Penguin Books,2019,288,Tiếng Anh,Sales & Marketing,https://www.fahasa.com/this-is-marketing-you-can-t-be-seen-until-you-learn-to-see-273347.html
Anne of Green Gables: The Sisterhood,"Anne of Green Gables: The Sisterhood


Including an introduction from writer and feminist activist Scarlett Curtis, curator of Sunday Times Bestseller 
Feminists Don't Wear Pink.


When waiting for an orphan boy to help with the work at Green Gables, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert are in for a big surprise.


Anne Shirley- a skinny, red-haired girl turns up instead.


Feisty and full of spirit, she soon charms her way into the Cuthberts' affection with her vivid imagination and constant chatter.


It's not long before Anne finds herself in trouble, but soon it becomes impossible for the Cuthberts to imagine life without 'their' Anne - and for the people of Avonlea to recall what it was like before this wildly creative little girl whirled into town.

Sleep is one of the most important aspects of our life, health and longevity and yet it is increasingly neglected in twenty-first-century society, with devastating consequences: every major disease in the developed world - Alzheimer's, cancer, obesity, diabetes - has very strong causal links to deficient sleep.


In this book, the first of its kind written by a scientific expert, Professor Matthew Walker explores twenty years of cutting-edge research to solve the mystery of why sleep matters. Looking at creatures from across the animal kingdom as well as major human studies, 
Why We Sleep
 delves into everything from what really happens during REM sleep to how caffeine and alcohol affect sleep and why our sleep patterns change across a lifetime, transforming our appreciation of the extraordinary phenomenon that safeguards our existence.

No Friend but the Mountains: The True Story of an Illegally Imprisoned Refugee,"No Friend but the Mountains: The True Story of an Illegally Imprisoned Refugee


The Award-winning International Bestselling Story of One Man's Six Year Detention in Australia


‘A powerfully vivid account of the experiences of a refugee: desperation, brutality, suffering, and all observed with an eye that seems to see everything and told in a voice that’s equal to the task.' - Phillip Pullman


In 2013, Kurdish journalist Behrouz Boochani sought asylum in Australia but was instead illegally imprisoned in the country’s most notorious detention centre on Manus Island. This book is the result.


Boochani spent nearly five years typing passages of this book one text at a time from a secret mobile phone in prison. Compiled and translated from Farsi, they form an incredible story of how escaping political persecution in Iran, he ended up trapped as a stateless person. This vivid, gripping portrait of his years of incarceration and exile shines devastating light on the fates of so many people, as borders close around the world.


No Friend but the Mountains 
is both a brave act of witness and a moving testament to the humanity of all people, in the most extreme of circumstances.


'A
 brilliant book. 
No Friend but the Mountains
 can rightly take its place on the shelf of world prison literature . . . It is a profound victory for a young poet who showed us all how much words can still matter.'

Rebel Talent: Why it Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life,"Rebel Talent: Why it Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life


'Great stories, great science, and great practical advice about how, when, and why to break the rules' - Angela Duckworth, international bestselling author of 
Grit.


Do you want to follow a script ― or write your own story?




Award-winning Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino shows us why the most successful among us break the rules, and how rebellion brings joy and meaning into our lives.


Rebels have a bad reputation. We think of them as troublemakers, outcasts, contrarians: those colleagues, friends, and family members who complicate seemingly straightforward decisions, create chaos, and disagree when everyone else is in agreement. But in truth, rebels are also those among us who change the world for the better with their unconventional outlooks. Instead of clinging to what is safe and familiar, and falling back on routines and tradition, rebels defy the status quo. They are masters of innovation and reinvention, and they have a lot to teach us.


Francesca Gino, a behavioral scientist and professor at Harvard Business School, has spent more than a decade studying rebels at organizations around the world, from high-end boutiques in Italy’s fashion capital, to the World’s Best Restaurant, to a thriving fast food chain, to an award-winning computer animation studio. In her work, she has identified leaders and employees who exemplify “rebel talent,” and whose examples we can all learn to embrace.


Gino argues that the future belongs to the rebel ― and that there’s a rebel in each of us. We live in turbulent times, when competition is fierce, reputations are easily tarnished on social media, and the world is more divided than ever before. In this cutthroat environment, cultivating rebel talent is what allows businesses to evolve and to prosper. And rebellion has an added benefit beyond the workplace: it leads to a more vital, engaged, and fulfilling life.


Whether you want to inspire others to action, build a business, or build more meaningful relationships, 
Rebel Talent
 will show you how to succeed ― by breaking all the rules.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_17771.jpg,Francesca Gino,Macmillan Publishers,2019,304,Tiếng Anh,Advice On Careers & Achieving Success,https://www.fahasa.com/rebel-talent-why-it-pays-to-break-the-rules-at-work-and-in-life.html

The Latte Factor: Why You Don't Have To Be Rich To Live Rich,"The Latte Factor: Why You Don't Have To Be Rich To Live Rich


Discover #1 
New York Times 
bestselling author David Bach’s three secrets to financial freedom in an engaging story that will show you that 
you are richer than you think
. Drawing on the author’s experiences teaching millions of people around the world to live a rich life, this fast, easy read reveals how anyone—from millennials to baby boomers—can 
still
 make their dreams come true.


In this compelling, heartwarming parable, Bach and his bestselling coauthor John David Mann (
The Go-Giver
) tell the story of Zoey, a twenty-something woman living and working in New York City. Like many young professionals, Zoey is struggling to make ends meet under a growing burden of credit card and student loan debt, working crazy hours at her dream job but still not earning enough to provide a comfortable financial cushion. At her boss’s suggestion, she makes friends with Henry, the elderly barista at her favorite Brooklyn coffee shop.


Henry soon reveals his “Three Secrets to Financial Freedom,” ideas Zoey dismisses at first but whose true power she ultimately comes to appreciate. Over the course of a single week, Zoey discovers that she already earns enough to secure her financial future and realize her truest dreams—all she has to do is make a few easy shifts in her everyday routine.


The Latte Factor
 demystifies the secrets to achieving financial freedom, inspiring readers to realize that it’s never too late to reach for your dreams. By following the simple, proven path that Henry shows Zoey, anyone can make small changes today that will have big impact for a lifetime, proving once again that “David Bach is the financial expert to listen to when you’re intimidated by your finances” (Tony Robbins, #1

After Ever Happy (The After Series Book 4),"After Ever Happy (The After Series Book 4)


Book Four of the After series—now newly revised and expanded, Anna Todd’s After fanfiction racked up 1 billion reads online and captivated readers across the globe. Experience the Internet’s most talked-about book for yourself!


Tessa and Hardin have defied all the odds, but will their fairy tale ending be turned on its head? 
After Ever Happy…
Life will never be the same. #HESSA


It’s never been all rainbows and sunshine for Tessa and Hardin, but each new challenge they’ve faced has only made their passionate bond stronger and stronger. But when a revelation about the past shakes Hardin’s inpenetrable façade to the core—and then Tessa suffers a tragedy—will they stick together again, or be torn apart?


As the shocking truth about each of their families emerges, it’s clear the two lovers are not so different from each other. Tessa is no longer the sweet, simple, good girl she was when she met Hardin—any more than he is the cruel, moody boy she fell so hard for. Tessa understands all the troubling emotions brewing beneath Hardin’s exterior, and she knows she’s the only one who can calm him when he erupts. He needs her.


But the more layers of his past come to light, the darker he grows, and the harder he pushes Tessa—and everyone else in his life—away. Tessa’s not sure if she really can save him—not without sacrificing herself. She refuses to go down without a fight. But who is she fighting for—Hardin or herself?",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781501106408.jpg,Anna Todd,Simon And Schuster,2015,512,Tiếng Anh,Romance,https://www.fahasa.com/after-ever-happy-the-after-series-book-4.html

"All the Way: Football, Fame, and Redemption (Special exclusive edition)","All the Way: Football, Fame, and Redemption (Special exclusive edition)


In the wake of the 50th anniversary of his legendary Super Bowl ""Guarantee,"" the NFL icon who first brought show business to sports shares his life lessons on fame, fatherhood, and football.


Three days before the 1969 Super Bowl, Joe Namath promised the nation that he would lead the New York Jets to an 18-point underdog victory against the seemingly invincible Baltimore Colts. When the final whistle blew, that promise had been kept.


Namath was instantly heralded as a gridiron god, while his rugged good looks, progressive views on race, and boyish charm quickly transformed him - in an era of raucous rebellion, shifting social norms, and political upheaval - into both a bona fide celebrity and a symbol of the commercialization of pro sports. By 26, with a championship title under his belt, he was quite simply the most famous athlete alive.


Although his legacy has long been cemented in the history books, beneath the eccentric yet charismatic personality was a player plagued by injury and addiction, both sex and substance. When failing knees permanently derailed his career, he turned to Hollywood and endorsements, not to mention a tumultuous marriage and fleeting bouts of sobriety, to try and find purpose. Now 74, Namath is ready to open up, brilliantly using the four quarters of Super Bowl III as the narrative backbone to a life that was anything but charmed.


As much about football and fame as about addiction, fatherhood, and coming to terms with our own mortality, 
All the Way
 finally reveals the man behind the icon.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_13084.jpg,"Don Yaeger, Joe Namath",Hachette Book Group,2019,336,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Sport,https://www.fahasa.com/all-the-way-football-fame-and-redemption-special-exclusive-edition.html

Brothers Down: Pearl Harbor and the Fate of the Many Brothers Aboard the USS Arizona,"Brothers Down: Pearl Harbor and the Fate of the Many Brothers Aboard the USS Arizona


A deeply personal and never-before-told account of one of America's darkest days, from the bestselling author of The Admirals and MacArthur at War. The surprise attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 remains one of the most traumatic events in American history. America's battleship fleet was crippled, thousands of lives were lost, and the United States was propelled into a world war. Few realize that aboard the iconic, ill-fated USS Arizona were an incredible 79 blood relatives.


Tragically, in an era when family members serving together was an accepted, even encouraged, practice, sixty-three of the Arizona's 1,177 dead turned out to be brothers. In Brothers Down, acclaimed historian Walter R. Borneman returns to that critical week of December, masterfully guiding us on an unforgettable journey of sacrifice and heroism, all told through the lives of these brothers and their fateful experience on the Arizona. Weaving in the heartbreaking stories of the parents, wives, and sweethearts who wrote to and worried about these men, Borneman draws from a treasure trove of unpublished source material to bring to vivid life the minor decisions that became a matter of life or death when the bombs began to fall. More than just an account of familial bonds and national heartbreak, what emerges promises to define a turning point in American military history.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_13072.jpg,Walter R.

INSTANT 
NEW YORK TIMES 
BESTSELLER!


Met and Yankee All-Star pitcher David Cone shares lessons from the World Series and beyond in this essential memoir for baseball fans everywhere.


""There was a sense about him and an aura about him. Even when he was in trouble, he carried himself like a pitcher who said, 'I'm the man out here.' And he usually was."" --Andy Pettitte on David Cone.


To any baseball fan, David Cone was a bold and brilliant pitcher. During his 17-year career, he became a master of the mechanics and mental toughness a pitcher needs to succeed in the major leagues. A five-time All-Star and five-time World Champion now gives his full count -- balls and strikes, errors and outs -- of his colorful life in baseball.


From the pitchers he studied to the hitters who infuriated him, 
Full Count 
takes readers inside the mind of a thoughtful pitcher, detailing Cone's passion, composure and strategies. The book is also filled with never-before-told stories from the memorable teams Cone played on -- ranging from the infamous late '80s Mets to the Yankee dynasty of the '90s.


And, along the way, 
Full Count
 offers the lessons baseball taught Cone -- from his mistakes as a young and naive pitcher to outwitting the best hitters in the world -- one pitch at a time.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_12992.jpg,David Cone,Hachette Book Group,2019,400,Tiếng Anh,Memoirs,https://www.fahasa.com/full-count-the-education-of-a-pitcher.html

A Voice for the Spirit Bears: How One Boy Inspired Millions to Save a Rare Animal,"A Voice for the Spirit Bears: How One Boy Inspired Millions to Save a Rare Animal


As a child, Simon Jackson found navigating the world of the school playground difficult. He felt most at home in the woodlands, learning about and photographing wildlife. As a teenager, he became fascinated with spirit bears, a rare subspecies of black bear with creamy white fur. These elusive creatures were losing their habitat to deforestation, and Simon knew he had to do something to protect them. He decided he would become the voice for the spirit bears. But first, he would have to find his own.


Carmen Oliver's inspiring true story is based on the early life of Simon Jackson, who founded the Spirit Bear Youth Coalition. On his remarkable journey to protect the spirit bears, he met Dr. Jane Goodall and eventually hiked the Great Bear Rainforest --- the home of these elusive animals. Katy Dockrill's captivating art adds depth and beauty to the story. Photos and additional details about Simon Jackson's life and about spirit bears are included in the end matter. Part of the CitizenKid collection, this book demonstrates how one child can be a voice for change. Simon's story is an excellent example of growth mindset at work, highlighting personal growth and overcoming obstacles through activism. This book can also be used to lead discussions about character education as it relates to courage, resilience and perseverance. In addition, it has strong science curriculum links to the environment, animal habitats and the effects of clear-cutting.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_13009.jpg,"Carmen Oliver, Katy Dockrill",Hachette Book Group,2019,32,Tiếng Anh,Biography: General,https://www.fahasa.com/a-voice-for-the-spirit-bears-how-one-boy-inspired-millions-to-save-a-rare-animal.html

A delightful tale of the first-ever teddy bear.


The story goes that on a hunting trip in 1902, President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear. A political cartoonist shared the story in the newspaper and then, impressed by the president’s big, warm heart, shopkeepers Rosie and Morris Michtom decided to create a “Teddy” bear in his honor to sell in their store. The bear was so popular, they made another. And another. And before they knew it, they needed to build a factory: it seemed every child wanted a teddy bear of their own!

This edition is an entirely new text based on manuscripts discovered in Linyi, China, in 1972 that predate all previous texts by as many as one thousand years. To better convey Sun-tzu's original intent, translator, researcher, and interpreter J. H. Huang traced the roots of the language to Sun-tzu's own time--before 221 b.c. In addition to his wonderfully clear interpretation, Huang gives readers an introduction to the history behind

Barking Up The Wrong Tree: The Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know About Success Is (Mostly) Wrong,"Barking Up The Wrong Tree: The Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know About Success Is (Mostly) Wrong


Wall Street Journal
 Bestseller


Much of the advice we've been told about achievement is logical, earnest...and downright wrong. In 
Barking Up the Wrong Tree
, Eric Barker reveals the extraordinary science behind what actually determines success and most importantly, how anyone can achieve it. You'll learn:


- Why valedictorians rarely become millionaires, and how your biggest weakness might actually be your greatest strength

- Whether nice guys finish last and why the best lessons about cooperation come from gang members, pirates, and serial killers

- Why trying to increase confidence fails and how Buddhist philosophy holds a superior solution

- The secret ingredient to ""grit"" that Navy SEALs and disaster survivors leverage to keep going

- How to find work-life balance using the strategy of Genghis Khan, the errors of Albert Einstein, and a little lesson from Spider-Man


By looking at what separates the extremely successful from the rest of us, we learn what we can do to be more like them--and find out in some cases why it's good that we aren't. 
Barking Up the Wrong Tree
 draws on startling statistics and surprising anecdotes to help you understand what works and what doesn't so you can stop guessing at success and start living the life you want.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_30333.jpg,Eric Barker,HarperCollins Publishers,2018,320,Tiếng Anh,Advice On Careers & Achieving Success,https://www.fahasa.com/barking-up-the-wrong-tree-intl.html
Leah On The Offbeat,"Leah On The Offbeat


#1 
New York Times
 bestseller! 
Goodreads Choice Award for the best young adult novel of the year!


In this sequel to the acclaimed 
Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda
--now a major motion picture, 
Love, Simon
--we follow Simon's BFF Leah as she grapples with changing friendships, first love, and senior year angst.


When it comes to drumming, Leah Burke is usually on beat--but real life isn't always so rhythmic.


She's an anomaly in her friend group: the only child of a young, single mom, and her life is decidedly less privileged. She loves to draw but is too self-conscious to show it. And even though her mom knows she's bisexual, she hasn't mustered the courage to tell her friends--not even her openly gay BFF, Simon.


So Leah really doesn't know what to do when her rock-solid friend group starts to fracture in unexpected ways. With prom and college on the horizon, tensions are running high.


It's hard for Leah to strike the right note while the people she loves are fighting--especially when she realizes she might love one of them more than she ever intended.

The Giving Tree,"The Giving Tree


From Shel Silverstein, New York Times bestselling author of Where the Sidewalk Ends and A Light in the Attic, comes a poignant picture book about love and acceptance, cherished for over fifty years. This classic is perfect for both young readers and lifelong fans.


""Once there was a tree...and she loved a little boy.""


So begins a story of unforgettable perception, beautifully written and illustrated by the gifted and versatile Shel Silverstein. This moving parable for all ages offers a touching interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.


Every day the boy would come to the tree to eat her apples, swing from her branches, or slide down her trunk...and the tree was happy. But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave. This is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation.


The Giving Tree is a meaningful gift for milestone events such as graduations, birthdays, and baby showers.


Shel Silverstein's incomparable career as a bestselling children's book author and illustrator began with Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back. He is also the creator of picture books including A Giraffe and a Half, Who Wants a Cheap Rhinoceros?, The Missing Piece, The Missing Piece Meets the Big O, and the perennial favorite The Giving Tree, and of classic poetry collections such as Where the Sidewalk Ends, A Light in the Attic, Falling Up, Every Thing On It, Don't Bump the Glump!, and Runny Babbit plus Runny Babbit Returns.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780060256654.jpg,Shel Silverstein,HarperCollins Publishers,2014,64,Tiếng Anh,Picture Books,https://www.fahasa.com/the-giving-tree-238719.html

Leonardo da Vinci,"The #1 
New York Times
 bestseller from Walter Isaacson 
brings Leonardo da Vinci to life in this exciting new biography that is ""a study in creativity: how to define it, how to achieve it...Most important, it is a powerful story of an exhilarating mind and life""
 (
The New Yorker
).


Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo da Vinci's astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson ""deftly reveals an intimate Leonardo"" (
San Francisco Chronicle
) in a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo's genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy.


He produced the two most famous paintings in history, 
The Last Supper
 and the 
Mona Lisa
. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. He explored the math of optics, showed how light rays strike the cornea, and produced illusions of changing perspectives in 
The Last Supper
. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of 
Vitruvian Man
, made him history's most creative genius.


In the ""luminous"" (
Daily Beast
) 
Leonardo da Vinci
, Isaacson describes how Leonardo's delight at combining diverse passions remains the ultimate recipe for creativity. So, too, does his ease at being a bit of a misfit: illegitimate, gay, vegetarian, left-handed, easily distracted, and at times heretical. His life should remind us of the importance to be imaginative and, like talented rebels in any era, to think different. Here, da Vinci ""comes to life in all his remarkable brilliance and oddity in Walter Isaacson's ambitious new biography...a vigorous, insightful portrait"" (
The Washington Post
).",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_181884.jpg,Walter Isaacson,Simon And Schuster,21/01/2019,624,Tiếng Anh,Individual Architects & Architectural Firms,https://www.fahasa.com/leonardo-da-vinci-234941.html

Quickprep New Toeic 600 - Volume 1,"TOEIC has long been widely recognized as one of the most effective tests in measuring English language proficiency in social life and in the workplace. For this reason, a TOEIC good score has become a requirement that many candidates have to meet, including those who want to work for big corporations and those who expect promotions, just to mention a few. For many people, TOEIC simply means a tool to help them acquire more opportunities ahead.


It is common sense that a solid competence in English is essential to achieve a high score on the TOEIC. But this is not enough if you do not get yourself familiar with the test specific format and testing points, which require careful preparation and intensive practice. Not only general language skill development is necessary, but you should also pay attention to specific tactics and strategies to tackle various question types and practical skills such as time management as well. One of the most proven effective method to build up and develop all these skills, tactics and strategies is to work on actual tests on a daily basis.


QuickPrep NEW TOEIC 600
 consists of 3 actual tests with 600 questions, aiming to provide you with reliable practice material following the most recent changes in TOEIC format. These practice tests are designed based on a thorough analysis of authentic new TOEIC test items and with a clear purpose of familiarizing you with what to expect when taking the test, in terms of both the level of difficulty and the challenge of maintaining focus under the exam pressure.


It is our strong belief that this preparation book will assist you in developing the most effective strategies for you to conquer the TOEIC test and achieve your target score.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_180847.jpg,"Michael A Putlack, Stephen Poirier, Tony Covello",Cty Nhân Trí Việt,2019,144,Tiếng Anh,Luyện Thi TOEIC ,https://www.fahasa.com/quickprep-new-toeic-600-volume-1.html

And when Mal's longtime rival Uma, daughter of Ursula, gets wind of this, she can't believe her luck. The tide has dragged in something good for a change, and Uma is determined to get her wicked hands on it. But first, she needs a pirate crew. 


A storm is brewing back in Auradon, and when Mal, Evie, Carlos, and Jay hear that the trident has been washed away, they realize they'll have to find it before anyone from the Isle does. Luckily, they seem to have a talent for locating missing magical objects.


As Uma readies for the high seas alongside Harry, son of Captain Hook, Gil, son of Gaston, and the toughest rogues on the Isle of the Lost, the reformed villains of Auradon devise their own master plan. And with King Ben away on royal business, they won't have to play by all the rules. Using bad for good can't be totally evil, right?


The thrilling, perilous race to the trident pits old friends-and current enemies-against each other with the future of Auradon on the line. Both teams might like to make waves, but only one will come out on top of this one.

Kitten's First Full Moon Board Book,"Kitten's First Full Moon Board Book


Kevin Henkes's acclaimed national bestseller about a kitten, the moon, and a bowl of milk was awarded the Caldecott Medal and was a New York Times Best Illustrated Book. This sturdy board book edition is perfect for little hands!


Kitten's First Full Moon is an acclaimed modern classic, from one of the most celebrated and beloved picture book creators working in the field today. This memorable character and her suspenseful adventure are just right for the very youngest child. It is Kitten's first full moon, and when she sees it she thinks it is a bowl of milk in the sky. And she wants it. Does she get it? Well, no . . . and yes. What a night!


A concise story, large type, and luminescent pictures play second fiddle to the true star of this book: a brave young kitten who sets out into the world on a quest that leaves her bruised, bewildered, and hungry, but that ultimately leads her back home, where something special is waiting just for her. This perfectly sized board book edition introduces Kitten to a new generation of the youngest readers.


Indefatigable Kitten is a role model for all ages—taking chances, picking herself up when she fails, trying out new strategies to get what she wants, and figuring out when enough is enough.

Magnus Chase And The Gods Of Asgard Book 1: The Sword Of Summer,"Magnus Chase And The Gods Of Asgard Book 1: The Sword Of Summer


Magnus Chase has seen his share of trouble. Ever since that terrible night two years ago when his mother told him to run, he has lived alone on the streets of Boston, surviving by his wits, staying one step ahead of the police and truant officers. One day, he's tracked down by an uncle he barely knows-a man his mother claimed was dangerous. Uncle Randolph tells him an impossible secret: Magnus is the son of a Norse god.


The Viking myths are true. The gods of Asgard are preparing for war. Trolls, giants, and worse monsters are stirring for doomsday. To prevent Ragnarok, Magnus must search the Nine Worlds for a weapon that has been lost for thousands of years.


When an attack by fire giants forces him to choose between his own safety and the lives of hundreds of innocents, Magnus makes a fatal decision.

Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.


Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil's name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.


But what Starr does--or does not--say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.

* ""This is a wonderful read for younger students that will also provide insight and encourage discussion about the wider world. ... The simplicity of Yousafzai's writing and the powerful message she sends, make this book inspirational for all.""


--- 
School Library Journal
 (starred review)


Malala's first picture book will inspire young readers everywhere to find the magic all around them.


As a child in Pakistan, Malala made a wish for a magic pencil. She would use it to make everyone happy, to erase the smell of garbage from her city, to sleep an extra hour in the morning. But as she grew older, Malala saw that there were more important things to wish for. She saw a world that needed fixing. And even if she never found a magic pencil, Malala realized that she could still work hard every day to make her wishes come true.


This beautifully illustrated volume tells Malala's story for a younger audience and shows them the worldview that allowed Malala to hold on to hope even in the most difficult of times.


""This is a wonderful read for younger students that will also provide insight and encourage discussion about the wider world. ... The simplicity of Yousafzai's writing and the powerful message she sends, make this book inspirational for all."" --

The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight In The Age Of Information Overload,"The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight In The Age Of Information Overload


In
 The Organized Mind
, 
New York Times
 and 
Sunday Times
 bestselling a
uthor and neuroscientist Daniel Levitin offers solutions for the problems of information overload.


Overwhelmed by demands on your time? Baffled by the sheer volume of data?


You're not alone. Even the smartest mind can't beat the organized mind - when we're unable to make sense of it all, our creativity plummets, our decision making suffers and we grow absent-minded. Nowadays, we drown under emails, forever juggle six tasks at once and try to make complex decisions ever more quickly. This is information overload.


Using a combination of academic research and examples from daily life, Daniel Levitin explains how to take back control of your life, from healthcare to online dating to raising kids, showing that the secret to success is always organization. You'll discover life-changing facts about:


- How to make the most of your brain's daily processing limit
 - Why pressing Send or clicking Like are addictive
 - Why daydreaming is your brain at its most productive
 - What the most successful people keep in their drawer
 - Why multitasking is a bad way to do nearly everything


In a world where information is power, 
The Organized Mind 
holds the key to harnessing that information and making it work for you.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780241965788.jpg,Daniel Levitin,Penguin Books,2015,528,Tiếng Anh,Management & Management Techniques,https://www.fahasa.com/the-organized-mind-thinking-straight-in-the-age-of-information-overload.html

But then a vital new force takes root and flourishes, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power: they can cause agonizing pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world drastically resets. From award-winning author Naomi Alderman, 
The Power
 is speculative fiction at its most ambitious and provocative, at once taking us on a thrilling journey to an alternate reality, and exposing our own world in bold and surprising ways.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195765.jpg,Naomi Alderman,Penguin Books,2017,288,Tiếng Anh,Society & Culture: General,https://www.fahasa.com/the-power-194617.html
The Little Book Of Lykke: The Danish Search For The World's Happiest People,"The Little Book Of Lykke: The Danish Search For The World's Happiest People


From the author of the international bestseller 
The Little Book of Hygge


Lykke (Luu-kah) (n): Happiness


It's easy to see why Denmark is often called the world's happiest country. Not only do they have equal parental leave for men and women, free higher education and trains that run on time, but they burn more candles per household than anywhere else.


So nobody knows more about happiness - what the Danes call 
lykke
 - than 
Meik Wiking
, 
CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen
 and author of the bestselling sensation 
The Little Book of Hygge
. But he believes that, whilst we can certainly learn a lot from the Danes about finding fulfilment, the keys to happiness are actually buried all around the globe.


In this captivating book, he takes us on a treasure hunt to unlock the doors to inner fulfilment. From how we spend our precious time, to how we relate to our neighbours and cook dinner, he gathers evidence, stories and tips from the very happiest corners of the planet. This is the ultimate guide to how we can all find a little more 
lykke
 in our lives.


Meik Wiking
 is the CEO of The Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen and is one of the world's leading experts in happiness. Committed to understanding happiness, subjective well-being and quality of life, Meik works with countries across the world to discover and explore global trends of life satisfaction. Only someone absolutely dedicated to happiness sits in coffee shops across the world counting peoples' smiles!

The Great Gatsby (Penguin Modern Classics),"The Great Gatsby (Penguin Modern Classics)


Now the subject of a major new film from director Baz Luhrmann (
Romeo+Juliet
, 
Moulin Rouge!
), starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan, 
The Great Gatsby
 
is F. Scott Fitzgerald's brilliant fable of the hedonistic excess and tragic reality of 1920s America. This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Tony Tanner.


Young, handsome and fabulously rich, Jay Gatsby is the bright star of the Jazz Age, but as writer Nick Carraway is drawn into the decadent orbit of his Long Island mansion, where the party never seems to end, he finds himself faced by the mystery of Gatsby's origins and desires. Beneath the shimmering surface of his life, Gatsby is hiding a secret: a silent longing that can never be fulfilled. And soon, this destructive obsession will force his world to unravel.

In 
The Great Gatsby
, Fitzgerald brilliantly captures both the disillusionment of post-war America and the moral failure of a society obsessed with wealth and status. But he does more than render the essence of a particular time and place, for - in chronicling Gatsby's tragic pursuit of his dream - Fitzgerald re-creates the universal conflict between illusion and reality.


Like Jay Gatsby, 
F. Scott Fitzgerald
 (1896–1940) has acquired a mythical status in American literary history, and his masterwork 
The Great Gatsby
 is considered by many to be the 'great American novel'. In 1920 he married Zelda Sayre, dubbed 'the first American Flapper', and their traumatic marriage and Zelda's gradual descent into insanity became the leading influence on his writing. As well as many short stories, Fitzgerald wrote five novels This Side of Paradise, 
The Great Gatsby
, The Beautiful and the Damned, Tender is the Night and, incomplete at the time of his death, The Last Tycoon. After his death The New York Times said of him that 'in fact and in the literary sense he created a ""generation"" '.


'A classic, perhaps the supreme American novel'

'Meet the new king of decluttering' - 
The Times


'Take your spring cleaning to the next level with 
Goodbye, Things
 by Fumio Sasaki' - 
Parade


'There's happiness in having less. If you are anything like how I used to be - miserable, constantly comparing yourself with others, or just believing your life sucks - I think you should try saying goodbye to some of your things'


Fumio Sasaki is a writer in his thirties who lives in a tiny studio in Tokyo with three shirts, four pairs of trousers, four pairs of socks and not much else. A few years ago, he realised that owning so much stuff was weighing him down - so he started to get rid of it.


In this hit Japanese bestseller, Sasaki explores the philosophy behind minimalism and offers a set of straightforward rules - discard it if you haven't used it in a year; be a borrower; find your uniform; keep photos of the things you love - that can help all of us lead simpler, happier, more fulfilled lives.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780141986388.jpg,Fumio Sasaki,Penguin Books,2017,256,Tiếng Anh,Style Guides,https://www.fahasa.com/goodbye-things.html

New TOEIC 4n4: 620 Level,"“
We are too busy and cannot take the time during the day to focus on our courseware.
“


“Đến công ty lúc 8 giờ 30 sáng. Mình cần sắp xếp lại tất cả những việc sẽ làm trong ngày hôm nay: gặp công ty S, công ty L vì công việc; hoàn thành bản dự thảo kế hoạch trong ngày; viết báo cáo công việc hàng tuần, … Nếu giải quyết được hết các công việc này thì mình có thể tan sở vào khoảng 7 giờ. Nếu hủy được cuộc hẹn tối nay với mấy người bạn, mình sẽ về ăn tối ở nhà rồi chơi với đứa con gái dễ thương của mình… nhưng mình sẽ học quyển TOEIC đã mua vào lúc nào?”


– Một ngày của trợ lý Kim thuộc tập đoàn N –


Trên đây là một ngày bình thường của những người học TOEIC là nhân viên trong các công ty. Những người này đã mua rất nhiều sách TOEIC và tự học ở nhà nhằm mục đích phát triển bản thân hoặc thi lấy chứng chỉ quốc tế với điểm cao để thăng tiến, v.v. nhưng khó khăn lớn nhất đối với họ chính là không có thời gian. “New TOEIC 4n4 giúp khắc phục điểm yếu chỉ trong 4 tuần” là quyển sách TOEIC phân loại điểm số được xuất bản dành cho những người bận rộn như vậy. Quyển sách này sẽ giúp giải quyết 4 điểm yếu lớn chỉ trong 4 tuần cho những người bận rộn khi học TOEIC.


Điểm yếu 1. Không dám dành thời gian để học.


Rất nhiều người không có thời gian, thậm chí còn không muốn dành ra một giờ mỗi ngày để học. Do vậy, chúng tôi đã biên soạn tài liệu này với phân lượng mà các bạn có thể học trong 20 ngày, và chỉ cần học một giờ mỗi ngày. Hãy học mà không cảm thấy nặng nề!


Điểm yếu 2. Khó tìm thấy tài liệu phù hợp với khả năng thực tế của bản thân.


Trên thị trường hiện nay, có rất nhiều sách TOEIC dày đến 500 trang và mỗi bộ gồm có hai quyển: Listening và Reading. Tuy nhiên, tìm được quyển sách phù hợp với khả năng của bản thân bạn không phải là việc dễ dàng. Vì vậy, bộ sách này được chia thành 4 cấp độ:
 520 điểm
, 
620 điểm
,
 730 điểm
 và
 860 điểm
. Ở mỗi cấp độ là các nội dung trọng tâm tương ứng. Nhờ vậy, người học có thể lựa chọn giáo trình phù hợp với trình độ của mình.


Điểm yếu 3. Rất khó tự học trong một thời gian dài.


Đối với người có thời gian thì họ sẽ đến học tại trung tâm ngoại ngữ gần nhà, nhưng những người đã đi làm khó có thời gian rảnh rỗi. Tuy nhiên, vấn đề đó sẽ được giải quyết bằng bài giảng hình ảnh được cung cấp kèm theo tài liệu này. Hãy cố gắng hoàn tất lịch học trong 20 ngày với những giảng viên danh tiếng nhất của Gangnam và Songno!


Điểm yếu 4. Vì đã lâu không tham dự các kỳ thi lấy chứng chỉ quốc tế nên không có cảm giác thi thực tế.


Do không phải là sinh viên nên việc chịu đựng thời gian làm bài thi New TOEIC quả là một gánh nặng đối với nhân viên công sở. Chính từ thực tế này, chúng tôi đã đưa vào sách nội dung “TOEIC know-how” nhằm giúp các bạn tự tin tham dự kỳ thi TOEIC, đồng thời trong phần phụ lục cũng có một bài kiểm tra mô phỏng thực tế. Nếu thực hành tốt tập tài liệu này, các bạn sẽ có đủ sự tự tin để tham dự kỳ thi TOEIC.

120 Bài Luận Tiếng Anh,"120 Bài Luận Tiếng Anh


Làm thế nào để có một bài tiểu luận thật lôi cuốn và hấp dẫn? Trước hết, bạn cần nắm rõ những tiêu chí sau trước khi đặt bút viết.


Viết tiểu luận tiếng Anh là một kỹ năng quan trọng để bạn hoàn thiện kỹ năng tổng hợp của mình. Ở trong bài tiểu luận bạn sẽ trình bày ý kiến, quan điểm của mình về một vấn đề nào đó trong cuộc sống, trong thơ văn hoặc một vấn đề mà bạn quan tâm. Nhưng làm thế nào để viết một bài tiểu luận thật lôi cuốn và hấp dẫn?


Tiểu luận đóng một vai trò quan trọng trong cuộc sống hàng ngày, trong các nghiên cứu khoa học cũng như trong trường học. Làm tiểu luận cũng là một cách để rèn luyện tư duy. Để có một bài tiểu luận hay thì ít nhất bài tiểu luận đó phải đạt những yêu cầu sau:


I. Phần mở bài


Đây là đoạn văn đầu tiên trong bài tiểu luận của bạn và nó phải hấp dẫn người đọc. Tránh bắt đầu một bài tiểu luận bằng những câu văn nhàm chán đại loại như ""In this essay I will explain why Rosa Parks was an important figure (Trong bài tiểu luận này tôi sẽ giải thích tại sao Rosa Parks lại quan trọng như thế)"".


Mà hãy thay nó bằng những câu kiểu như thế này:


A Michigan museum recently paid $492.000 for an old, dilapidated bus from Montgomery, Alabama. (Gần đây viện bảo tàng Michigan đã mua một chiếc xe buýt cũ từ Montgomery, Alabama với giá kỷ lục $492,000).


Rõ ràng là khi đọc câu thứ hai người đọc sẽ phải băn khoăn rằng tại sao một chiếc xe buýt cũ kỹ mà lại có cái giá cao ngất ngưởng như thế. Và thế là vì tò mò, họ sẽ đọc tiếp bài tiểu luận của bạn để tìm câu trả lời.


Thứ hai, bạn phải giới thiệu được chủ đề mà mình muốn nói. Câu tiếp theo trong phẩn mở bài bạn nên giải thích cho câu thứ nhất và chuẩn bị cho câu chủ đề của bài tiểu luận.


 Ví dụ:


The old yellow bus was reported to be the very one that sparked the ciUvil rights movement, when a young woman named Rosa Parks…(Chiếc xe buýt màu vàng nói trên là vật đánh dấu bước tiến quan trọng trong quyền dân sự khi mà người phụ nữ trẻ mang tên Rosa Parks…)


Tiếp theo là bạn phải thể hiện ý kiến của bạn trong câu chủ đề. Trong câu chủ đề, bạn nên thể hiện rõ ràng quan điểm và ý kiến của mình.


Ví dụ:


In refusing to surrender her seat to a white man, Rosa Parks inspired a courageous freedom movement that lives on, even today. (Từ chối sự thoả hiệp với người da trắng, Rosa Parks đã tạo một bước tiến lớn trên con đường đến với tự do tồn tại đến tận ngày nay).


II. Phần thân bài


Phần thân bài của một bài tiểu luận phải gồm ít nhất là ba đoạn văn, mỗi đoạn văn phải diễn đạt một ý để bổ sung cho ý chính của bài tiểu luận. Bạn nên diễn đạt ý chính của mình và sau đó quay lại bằng một hoặc hai câu nêu lên dẫn chứng với các số liệu hoặc ví dụ. Nếu ý chính của bạn là:


It took incredible courage for an African American woman to make such a bold stance in 1955 Alabama. (Đó là một sự can đảm kỳ diệu của một người Mỹ gốc Phi để tạo nên lập trường vững chắc tại Alabama vào năm 1955).


Vậy thì các ý phụ để bổ sung cho ý chính của bạn có thể là:


This act took place in an era when Africa Americans could be arrested and face severe retribution for committing the most trivial acts of defiance. (Hành động này đã thay đổi cả một kỷ nguyên khi mà người Mỹ gốc Phi có thế bị bắt và đối mặt với rất nhiều trừng phạt nguy hiểm vì họ không có cả những kháng cự bình thường nhất).


Bạn có thể sử dụng thêm một vài ý khác nữa để bổ sung cho ý chính mà bạn muốn nói, sau đó bổ sung thêm số liệu nhưng hãy ghi nhớ sử dụng từ nối để chuyển ý sang một đoạn văn mới. Bạn có thể sử dụng một vài từ nối như: moreover (thêm vào đó), in fact (thực tế là), on the whole (nói tóm lại), furthermore (thêm vào đó), as a result (kết quả là), for this reason (vì lý do này), similarly (tương tự như), likewise (tương tự như), its follows that (theo sau là), naturally (một cách tự nhiên), by comparison (so với), surely (chắc chắn), yet (nhưng)…


III. Kết luận


Đoạn văn cuối cùng sẽ là tổng kết lại ý những ý chính mà bạn đã nói và nêu lại ý kiến của bạn một lần nữa. Bạn nên nhắc lại chính kiến của mình một lần nữa nhưng không nên nhắc lại các số liệu và các ví dụ.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/8/9/8935092547107.jpg,Nhã Ân,Cty Văn Hóa Khang Việt,2017,350,Tiếng Anh,Ngữ Pháp,https://www.fahasa.com/120-bai-luan-tieng-anh-183600.html

Mindmap English,"Nhà ngôn ngữ học nổi tiếng D.A.Wilkins đã nói rằng “Without grammar, very little can be conveyed; without vocabulary, nothing can be conveyed.” (Không có ngữ pháp, rất ít thông tin có thể được truyền đạt; Không có từ vựng, không một thông tin nào có thể được truyền đạt cả). Vì thế, trong việc học một ngoại ngữ, thì từ vựng có thể xem như các tế bào nhỏ hình thành nên khả năng sử dụng ngoại ngữ của người học.


Các bạn đang băn khoăn chưa biết nên học từ vựng như thế nào để có thể ghi nhớ được nhiều từ và lâu nhất. Dưới đây là những phương pháp học mà các bạn có thể áp dụng để học từ vựng hiệu quả nhất.


1. Học từ vựng theo chủ đề
 Thay vì học riêng lẻ từng từ rời rạc, nếu các bạn biết nhóm chúng vào cùng một chủ đề thì đảm bảo việc học thuộc sẽ trở nên đơn giản hơn rất nhiều luôn. Có vốn từ vựng theo chủ đề, khi làm bài thi nói hoặc viết theo một chủ đề nào đó bạn sẽ phát huy được tối đa vốn từ vựng. Khiến bài nói và bài viết của bạn trôi chảy và nhiều ý tưởng. Vì vậy, việc học từ theo chủ đề cũng giống như một mũi tên trúng hai đích vậy, vừa giúp chúng ta biết thêm nhiều từ mới, vừa có nhiều từ vựng và ý hay để triển khai cho bài thi được tốt hơn.


2. Sử dụng hình ảnh, âm thanh hay câu chuyện để ghi nhớ từ vựng nhanh
 Thực tế cho thấy, cách mà nhiều người thường hay học từ vựng đó là viết từ vựng đó kèm nghĩa ra giấy thật nhiều lần để ghi nhớ. Tuy nhiên, cách này có thể hiệu quả tức thời nhưng về lâu về dài, nếu không sử dụng lại thì chắc chắn ta sẽ quên từ. Ngược lại, nếu sử dụng những hình ảnh, âm thanh hay câu chuyện ấn tượng thì có thể khiến não bộ chúng ta nhớ rất mãi. Cách thức học này cũng vô cùng đơn giản, khi chúng ta học một từ mới, hãy cố gắng tự nghĩ ý tưởng và minh họa cho nó bằng hình ảnh ngộ nghĩnh, khi học một nhóm từ vựng theo chủ đề, hãy cố gắng sắp xếp chúng vào thành một đoạn văn, kể về một câu chuyện thú vị.


3. Học từ vựng qua bài hát, phim ảnh


Nhiều lúc do tâm lý nghĩ học tập là một gánh nặng, bắt buộc phải học mà khiến chúng ta mất đi niềm vui trong việc tiếp nhận tri thức. Nếu các bạn có thể giải tỏa tâm lý đó bằng việc nghe nhạc hay xem phim thì sẽ khiến từ mới “vào đầu” dễ dàng hơn mà không khiến ta chán nản khi học. Các bạn nên học từ vựng bằng những phim từ mức độ thấp đến cao. Rất nhiều bộ phim hay để học tiếng Anh như: Extra English, Friends, How I met your mother?...


4. Luôn có một cuốn sổ tay ghi từ mới
 Cuốn sổ này sẽ cực kì hữu ích cho bạn trong việc học mọi lúc mọi nơi. Mỗi ngày bạn hay ghi vào quyển sổ đó những từ mới học được bao gồm nghĩa, họ từ và ngày nào cũng mở ra đọc và học lại như vậy từ vựng đó sẽ không bao giờ có thể quên được.


5. Tập sử dụng các từ mới và ôn tập thường xuyên
 Sau khi học các từ mới, bạn nên tập sử dụng chúng hàng",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/2/4/24df17f9bab58ba053c6c08c3af2f470.jpg,The Windy,MCBooks,2019,260,Tiếng Anh,Từ Vựng,https://www.fahasa.com/tu-hoc-2000-tu-vung-tieng-anh-theo-chu-de-182109.html

Invisible Influence,"Jonah Berger, the bestselling author of 
Contagious
, explores the subtle, secret influences that affect the decisions we make--from what we buy, to the careers we choose, to what we eat--in his latest 
New York Times
 bestseller that is a ""rare business book that's both informative and enough fun to take to the beach"" (Fortune.com).


If you're like most people, you think your individual tastes and opinions drive your choices and behaviors. You wear a certain jacket because you liked how it looked. You picked a particular career because you found it interesting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions is patently obvious. Right? Wrong.


Without our realizing it, other people's behavior has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane to the momentous. Even strangers have an impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes toward a welfare policy shift if we're told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans (even though the policy is the same). But social influence doesn't just lead us to do the same things as others. In some cases we imitate others around us. But in other cases we 
avoid
 particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream. We skip buying the minivan because we don't want to look like a soccer mom.


By understanding how social influence works, we can decide when to resist and when to embrace it--and learn how we can use this knowledge to exercise more control over our own behavior. In 
Invisible Influence
, Jonah Berger ""is consistently entertaining, applying science to real life in surprising ways and explaining research through narrative. His book fascinates because it opens up the moving parts of a mysterious machine, allowing readers to watch them in action"" (
Publishers Weekly

"The Song Of Middle-Earth: J. R. R. Tolkien's Themes, Symbols And Myths","The Song Of Middle-Earth: J. R. R. Tolkien's Themes, Symbols And Myths


Available for the first time in paperback, this is the pre-eminent critical study, and exploration, of how myth and legend played such a significant role in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.


The Song of Middle-earth takes a fresh look at The Lord of the Rings, digging deep into the foundations of Tolkien’s world to reveal the complex tapestry of history and mythology that lies behind his stories.


The charge that Tolkien's work was merely derivative – that he extracted elements from other mythologies and incorporated them into his own fiction – is dismissed in favour of a fascinating examination of the rich historical background to Middle-earth.


From the mythic tradition of the Tales told in The Book of Lost Tales: I to the significance of oral storytelling throughout the history of Middle-earth, this book examines the common themes of mythology found within Tolkien’s work.


In doing so, The Song of Middle-earth demonstrates how Tolkien’s desire to create a new mythology for England is not only apparent in his writing, but also realised.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780008184810.jpg,David Harvey,Usborne,2016,240,Tiếng Anh,Literature: History & Criticism,https://www.fahasa.com/the-song-of-middle-earth-j-r-r-tolkien-s-themes-symbols-and-myths.html

Business Without The Bullsh*t: 49 Secrets And Shortcuts You Need To Know,"Business Without The Bullsh*t: 49 Secrets And Shortcuts You Need To Know


Contrary to popular belief, the business world is not that complicated. While every industry and every profession requires specific expertise, the truth is that the 'business of business' is relatively simple.


For the past seven years, Geoffrey James has written a daily blog that's become one of the most popular business-focused destinations on the web. In 
Business Without The Bullsh*t
, readers will learn surprising but tried-and-true secrets about being an extraordinary boss, about coping with annoying coworkers, and navigating the thorny problems that recur in every workplace.


TIPS FROM BUSINESS WITHOUT THE BULLSH*T:


Long work hours mean less work gets done.
Multiple studies reveal that working 60 rather than 40 hours a week makes you slightly more productive but only for a little while. After about three weeks , people get burned out, get sick and go absent, and start making avoidable errors.


What every boss wants from you. 
From your boss's perspective your real job is to make the boss successful. There are no exceptions to this rule.


Why your resume is your enemy.
Only write a resume 
after
 you're talking to people inside the hiring firm. Then, customise it to match what you've discovered that they 
really 
want.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781455541423_11.jpg,Geoffrey James,Hachette Book Group,2016,277,Tiếng Anh,Business & Management,https://www.fahasa.com/business-without-the-bullsh-t-49-secrets-and-shortcuts-you-need-to-know.html

A Man Called Ove,"A Man Called Ove


Read the
 New York Times 
bestseller that has taken the world by storm!


Meet Ove. He’s a curmudgeon—the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him “the bitter neighbor from hell.” But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn’t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time?


Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove’s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents’ association to their very foundations.


A feel-good story in the spirit of 
The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry
 and 
Major Pettigrew’s Last Stand
, Fredrik Backman’s novel about the angry old man next door is a thoughtful exploration of the profound impact one life has on countless others. “If there was an award for ‘Most Charming Book of the Year,’ this first novel by a Swedish blogger-turned-overnight-sensation would win hands down” (

Dune,"Dune


In 1965, after being rejected by more than a dozen publishing houses, a book called ""Dune"" was brought out by the Chilton Book Company. Its respected author, journalist Frank Herbert, had written ""Dune"" with nothing more in mind than to entertain his readers with the telling of a particularly complex story, one which had occupied his thoughts for more than six years. No one - not Herbert, not Chilton, not the science fiction community at the time - had any idea that ""Dune"" would be adopted and read by successive generations with a fervor bordering on cult worship. Or that it would prove to be merely the first of what have now become five international bestsellers about a desert world of the future - the planet Arrakis, called Dune.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780441172719.jpg,Frank Herbert,Penguin Books,1996,896,Tiếng Anh,Science Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/dune.html

Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography,"Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography


Walter Isaacson’s “enthralling” (The New Yorker) worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs.


Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years—as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues—Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson’s portrait touched millions of readers.


At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.


Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against.


His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.


His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.


Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780349140438.jpg,Walter Isaacson,Littlehampton Book Services,2015,592,Tiếng Anh,Biography: Business & Industry,https://www.fahasa.com/steve-jobs-the-exclusive-biography.html

In The Magic, Rhonda Byrne reveals this life-changing knowledge to the world. Then, on an incredible 28-day journey, she teaches you how to apply this knowledge in your everyday life. No matter who you are, no matter where you are, no matter what your current circumstances, The Magic is going to change your entire life!""",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_81136.jpg,Rhonda Byrne,Simon And Schuster,03/06/2012,254,Tiếng Anh,Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/the-magic.html

Happiness - Essential Mindfulness Practices,"Happiness - Essential Mindfulness Practices


Thich Nhat Hanh's central teaching is that, through mindfulness, we can learn to live in the present moment instead of in the past and in the future. It's only way to truly develop peace, both in one's self and in the world. Now, for the first time, all Thich Nhat Hanh's key practices are collected in one accessible and easy-to-use volume.


Happiness is structured to introduce those new to Buddhist teachings as well as for more experienced practitioners, serving as a quintessential resource of mindfulness practices. Integrating these practices into daily life allows the reader to begin to cultivate peace and joy within him/herself, leading to solidity and freedom from fear, misunderstanding, and suffering.


With the practices offered in Happiness, Thich Nhat Hanh encourages the reader to learn to do all the things they do in daily life with mindfulness; to walk, sit, work, eat, and drive, with full awareness of what they are doing. It can bring about a shift towards one of the principles of engaged Buddhism, a shift towards practicing mindfulness in every moment of the day and not just while 'formally' meditating.


Thich Nhat Hanh encourages his readers to ""try to be intelligent and skillful in their practice, approaching every aspect of the practice with curiosity and a sense of search. It's important to practice with understanding and not just for the form and appearance. Enjoy your practice with a relaxed and gentle attitude, with an open mind and receptive heart.""",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781888375916.jpg,Thich Nhat Hanh,Penguin Books,25/09/2009,120,Tiếng Anh,"Mind, Body, Spirit: Thought & Practice",https://www.fahasa.com/happiness-essential-mindfulness-practices.html

Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics,"Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics


""Nearly forty years after I first got involved, I remain captivated by the possibilities of politics and public service. In fact, I believe that my chosen profession is a noble calling. That's why I wanted to be a part of it."" -Joe Biden As a United States senator from Delaware since 1973, Joe Biden has been an intimate witness to the major events of the past four decades and a relentless actor in trying to shape recent American history. He has seen up close the tragic mistake of the Vietnam War, the Watergate and Iran-contra scandals, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the reunification of Germany, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, a presidential impeachment, a presidential resignation, and a presidential election decided by the Supreme Court. He's observed Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and two Bushes wrestling with the presidency; he's traveled to war zones in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa and seen firsthand the devastation of genocide. He played a vital role by standing up to Ronald Reagan's effort to seat Judge Robert Bork on the Supreme Court, fighting for legislation that protects women against domestic violence, and galvanizing America's response (and the world's) to Slobodan Milosevic's genocidal march in the Balkans.


In ""Promises to Keep,"" Biden reveals what these experiences taught him about himself, his colleagues, and the institutions of government. With his customary candor, Biden movingly recounts growing up in a staunchly Catholic multigenerational household in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington, Delaware; overcoming a demoralizing stutter; marriage, fatherhood, and the tragic death of his wife Neilia and infant daughter Naomi; remarriage and re-forming a family with his second wife, Jill; success and failure in the Senate and on the campaign trail; two life-threatening aneurysms; his relations with fellow lawmakers on both sides of the aisle; and his leadership of powerful Senate committees. Through these and other recollections, Biden shows us how the guiding principles he learned early in life-the obligation to work to make people's lives better, to honor family and faith, to get up and do the right thing no matter how hard you've been knocked down, to be honest and straightforward, and, above all, to keep your promises-are the foundations on which he has based his life's work as husband, father, and public servant. ""Promises to Keep"" is the story of a man who faced down personal challenges and tragedy to become one of our most effective leaders. It is also an intimate series of reflections from a public servant who refuses to be cynical about political leadership, and a testament to the promise of the United States.

Keeper of the Lost Cities,"In this riveting debut, a telepathic girl must figure out why she is the key to her brand-new world--before the wrong person finds the answer first. Twelve-year-old Sophie has never quite fit into her life. She's skipped multiple grades and doesn't really connect with the older kids at school, but she's not comfortable with her family, either. The reason? Sophie's a Telepath, someone who can read minds. No one knows her secret--at least, that's what she thinks... But the day Sophie meets Fitz, a mysterious (and adorable) boy, she learns she's not alone. He's a Telepath too, and it turns out the reason she has never felt at home is that, well...she isn't.

Einstein: His Life and Universe,"Einstein: His Life and Universe


By the author of the acclaimed bestsellers 
Benjamin Franklin 
and 
Steve Jobs
, this is the definitive biography of Albert Einstein.
 


How did his mind work? What made him a genius? Isaacson's biography shows how his scientific imagination sprang from the rebellious nature of his personality. His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom. 


Based on newly released personal letters of Einstein, this book explores how an imaginative, impertinent patent clerk--a struggling father in a difficult marriage who couldn't get a teaching job or a doctorate--became the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom, and the universe. His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals. 


These traits are just as vital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will depend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the last century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9780743264747.jpg,Walter Isaacson,Simon And Schuster,2008,704,Tiếng Anh,"Biography: Science, Technology & Engineering",https://www.fahasa.com/einstein-his-life-and-universe.html

Master Toefl Junior-Advanced (Cefr Level B2)-Listening Comprehension (+Cd),"Each book in the
Master TOEFL Junior
 series includes a carefully researched and detailed guide to each part of the TOEFL Junior Test. This series was designed to give test-takers the skills and knowledge needed to obtain a high score on the TOEFL Junior Test.


This guide is for students who wish to assess their grasp of the communication skills necessary for participating in an English language learning environment. The TOEFL Junior Test provides parents and educators with objective information about improvements in a student’s English ability over time. It also serves as a comprehensive measurement that can be helpful in gaining students admission to selective educational programs. This book will be a great asset for EFL students who wish to enter middle schools and exchange programs across America.


This book contains eight parts.


The Orientation


The Diagnostic Test
: This section of the book will assess your current listening ability. The diagnostic test tells you your listening strengths and also what you should focus on to improve your skills. Additionally the diagnostic test gives you a grade you can refer back to once you take the practice tests to see how much your listening skill has improved since you began this book.


The Question Types
: This segment of the book gives you a detailed look at each question type on the TOEFL Junior.


The Strategies
: Here is where you will learn tricks and hints to help you answer each question type successfully. This section also includes methods you can use to recognize specific question types and explains the test’s traps used to trick you into answering incorrectly.


The Example Questions
: This portion of each strategy unit illustrates how a specific question type appears in a listening dialogue. Each example question is an opportunity to practice answering a specific question type on its own before you encounter them mixed with the various other question types. Each example question is followed by a full explanation, providing the correct answer and reasons why the other choices are incorrect.


The Dictation Questions
: This section’s main purpose is to give you an opportunity to practice listening for key phrases. Key phrases are necessary in understanding each dialogue and answering the question given in each dictation section. The dictation portion of each unit also acts as a second example question so you can practice a specific question type before tackling the practice tests.


The Practice Tests
: Each question type unit has a practice test to give you a chance to answer specific question types on their own before trying out the actual test at the end of this book. The practice tests will show your improvements on each question type as you study their specific units.


The Sample Actual Test
: The last section of this book is your chance to see what you learned and how much you have improved. It will give you a feeling for what you should expect on the real TOEFL Junior listening test. This sample actual test is only based on the announcements/talks and the conversations.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/9/7/9786045826171.jpg,Richie Hahn,Cty Nhân Trí Việt,2014,126,Tiếng Anh,Luyện Thi TOEFL,https://www.fahasa.com/master-toefl-junior-advanced-cefr-level-b2-grammar-32770.html
To Kill A Mockingbird,"To Kill A Mockingbird


'Shoot all the Bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a Mockingbird.'


Lawyer Atticus Finch gives this advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel - a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much...


A benchmark of classic American literature, To Kill A Mockingbird approaches the highly sensitive topic of racism in 1930s America with humour, warmth and compassion, making it widely recognised as one of the best books of the twentieth century and in American literature.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_23384.jpg,Harper Lee,Grantham Book Services,1989,320,Tiếng Anh,Contemporary Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/to-kill-a-mockingbird.html

Kafka On The Shore,"Kafka On The Shore 


Kafka on the Shore
 follows the fortunes of two remarkable characters. Kafka Tamura runs away from home at fifteen, under the shadow of his father's dark prophesy. The aging Nakata, tracker of lost cats, who never recovered from a bizarre childhood affliction, finds his pleasantly simplified life suddenly turned upside down. Their parallel odysseys are enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerising dramas. Cats converse with people; fish tumble from the sky; a ghostlike pimp deploys a Hegel-spouting girl of the night; a forest harbours soldiers apparently un-aged since WWII. There is a savage killing, but the identity of both victim and killer is a riddle. Murakami's new novel is at once a classic tale of quest, but it is also a bold exploration of mythic and contemporary taboos, of patricide, of mother-love, of sister-love. Above all it is an entertainment of a very high order.",https://cdn1.fahasa.com/media/catalog/product/i/m/image_195509_1_22797.jpg,Haruki Murakami,Grantham Book Services,2005,624,Tiếng Anh,Contemporary Fiction,https://www.fahasa.com/kafka-on-the-shore.html

Philip, the heir to Ambrose's beautiful English estate, is crushed that the man he loved died far from home. He is also suspicious.

Now Rachel has arrived at Philip's newly inherited estate. Could this exquisite woman, who seems to genuinely share Philip's grief at Ambrose's death, really be as cruel as Philip imagined? Or is she the kind, passionate woman with whom Ambrose fell in love? Philip struggles to answer this question, knowing Ambrose's estate, and his own future, will be destroyed if his answer is wrong.
